INTRODUCTION.
may

be taken for granted that, from the time when Akerblad,
Young and Champollion le Jeune laid the foundation of the

It

science of Egyptology in the

first

quarter of the nineteenth century

down to the present day, every serious student of Egyptian texts,
whether hieroglyphic, hieratic or demotic, has found it necessary
to compile in one form or another his own Egyptian Dictionary.

which we owe to them. I therefore propose, before passing on to
describe the circumstances under which the present Egyptian
Hieroglyphic Dictionary has been produced, to recall briefly
the labours of the " famous men " who have preceded me in the
field of Egyptian lexicography, and " who were honoured in their
generations, and were the glory of their times."

The

great value and importance of Young's application of the

phonetic principle to Egyptian hieroglyphs has been

summed up

with characteristic French terseness and accuracy by Chabas,

who

the distinguished Egyptologist,

wrote, " Cette id6e fut, dans

lux de la science."'
Curiously enough Young did not

inability to decide upon the system of arrangement that ought to
be employed in an Egyptian Dictionary, that prevented him from
publishing the work during his lifetime. His difficulty is described

has the advantage of bringing together such words as nearly

and it appears most likely to be subservient
to the purposes of future investigation, to employ an imitation

proclaiming the superior merits of that of Champollion, and
others advocating the extraordinary views of Spohn and Seyffarth

no information about them, and the only result of his labour
was to make widely known the fact that they were lost. The
savants of the day, remembering how freely ChampoUion lent his
writings to his intimate friends, hoped that they were not lost
but only mislaid by some friend who had forgotten all about them.
A year passed, and nothing was heard of the lost manuscripts.
Meanwhile Champollion-Figeac began to suspect that one of his

quarto was absurd on the face of it, and as Champollion-Figeac
knew that his brother had written monographs on the very texts
that were mentioned in the prospectus, he came to the conclusion
that Salvolini had stolen the missing manuscripts. This was
quite possible, for Salvolini had had free access to the study of
ChampoUion, and was constantly in his house during his last
illness.
In August, 1833, at a public meeting of the Academic
des Inscriptions Silvestre de Sacy solemnly called upon the man
or men who had the missing manuscripts in their possession
to restore them to their author's family, and Salvolini had the
audacity to join him in mourning the loss of them, and with tears
in his eyes he implored the man who had them to give them up.
And at that moment he was announcing the publication of them
under his own name
Still nothing was heard of the missing
manuscripts. In February, 1838, Salvolini died, aged 28. ChampoUion-Figeac tried to find out what papers he had left behind,
and was told that they had been claimed by a foreign messenger,
and that they had been sent beyond the Alps. As a matter of
fact, they had never left Paris, where they remained forgotten

could for his friend's family, tried to sell them, but no one would
buy them. Finally, not knowing what else to do with the manuscripts, he wished to show them to Charles Lenormant, the friend
and fellow traveller of ChampoUion, and to take his advice on
the subject. At first Lenormant refused to look at them, but

ChampoUionFigeac
accepts the

arrangement
of the
" Scala."

He

rejects

the Chinese

arrangement
of characters.

Introduction.

Such was the arrangement of words in the model which
ChampoUion-Figeac took as a guide for the arrangement of words
in his brother's Egyptian Dictionary, and he asks the question
" L'experience ou le raisonnement indiquaient ils une autre
ra6thode ? " Experience, he says, suggests a single example only,
namely the Chinese, but having described at some length the
differences that exist between the Chinese and Egyptian languages,
he decides that even if analogies and a similitude between these
two languages did exist originally they do so no longer. The
Chinese Dictionary must not be employed as the model for a
Hieroglyphic Dictionary, only the Coptic Scala is any use for this
purpose.
Champollion-Figeac then goes on to mention that
another system has been proposed and even tried, namely that
advocated by Samuel Birch in his " Sketch of a Hieroglyphical
Dictionary." Having examined the Preface to this work he
says, " Though the specimen, which I owe to the courtesy of Mr.
Birch, is brief, it seems to me to be sufficient to make clear the
defect in the general plan adopted by this scholar.

although the absolute want of one has been long felt." This
Preface is dated April 13th, 1867. The publication of the first
Egyptian Dictionary arranged on phonetic, i.e., alphabetic,
principles, and printed in hieroglyphic type, was a great triumph
for English Egyptology and the craft of the typographer, and to
Birch the compiler and Spottiswoode the prhiter, and Longmans

and there seems to
be no doubt that public interest in Bunsen's scheme of chronology
drooped when its author died in i860, the year which saw tlie
appearance of the fourth volume, and was practically dead when
the fifth volume was published in 1867.
According to Birch,
"
the volume fell
flat," and its editor and publishers were greatly
disappointed.
Whether the edition was a small one or not I have
no evidence to show, but it was certainly the fact that for some
reason or other copies of the volume were difficult to get in the
early " seventies."

When I attended Birch's Egyptian
classes in 1875-76 and needed the book urgently, I was obliged
to trace each page of it on a separate sheet of tracing paper,
omitting the references, and when these sheets were bound I
used them for some years with great benefit. Moreover, the

great deal of information which, it seems to me, should have

cost of printing the Dictionary, even on the Continent, where great
scholarly works are often subsidized by the Government, it was
decided to reproduce Brugsch's manuscript by lithography, which
B^gsch's
in those days was a tolerably inexpensive method of publication
and Brugsch undertook to write the transfers for the lithographer knowledge of
with his own hand. Thus he was given practically a free hand Egyptology,
by his publisher, and a Dictionary containing 3,125 pages is the
result.
The amount of Egyptological knowledge which he displays in this truly great work is marvellous, and his familiarity
with the contents of the most difficult texts, whether hieroglyphic,
hieratic or demotic, is phenomenal.
He was the greatest Egyptologist that Germany had produced, and his energy and zeal and
devotion and power of work must ever command our warmest
admiration.
Brugsch, like Birch, arranged the words in his
Hieroglyphic Dictionary alphabetically, and it is an interesting
fact that both scholars, apparently independently, came to the
conclusion that ChampoUion's " natural and rational " system of He rejects

under the name of Dictionnaire Egyptien, could and can lay claim

older Theban Recension translated from the rich collection of
XVIIIth dynasty papyri in the British Museum. The smaller
papyri had been cut up into sections and mounted under sheets
of glass, and were at that time arranged in drawers in the TableCases in the public rooms. The longer papyri, i.e., those which
measured from 5 to 30 feet in length, had been mounted in black
glazed wooden frames and hung upon the walls of the North-West
Staircase.
But as in this position it was well-nigh impossible to
consult them, and as it was feared that they might suffer injury
through damp, they were taken down and, where possible, were
cut up into sections, mounted under sheets of glass and stored

Between 1888 and 1892 the British Museum acquired

and other remarkable Codices of the Theban Recension of the

work was that I filled many
boxes and drawers with slips on each of which a word was written,
with its certain or problematical meaning, and a reference to the
text or monument where it was to be found.
In 1908 I had
written over three hundred thousand slips, and in spite of the
constant help of my wife in arranging them and in making incorporations, I realised that the publication of such a mass of material
was impossible. No one man could write the fair copy of it for
press, and no publisher could afford to undertake its publication.
I therefore set to work to revise the slips, and to destroy all that

which were commonly accepted. In this revision I got rid of
more than one-half of the slips, but even then the compilation
was far too large, and further revision was necessary. I then
cut out all the numerous quotations from texts, and nearly all
comments, abbreviated the references to published works, and,
at the risk of making a somewhat bald Egyptian Vocabulary,
eschewed, except in very rare cases, any attempt to discuss
theoretical renderings of words.
This second revision was completed in 1913, and the slips which I proposed to print numbered

was a close affinity between the Egyptian and Semitic languages

Birch's view was that the " greater portion of the words
[in the ancient Egyptian language] are an old form of the Coptic
others, no longer found in that tongue, appear (to be) of Semitic
origin, and have been gradually introduced into the language
from the Aramaic and other sources. A few words are IndoGermanic."^ Brugsch stated categorically that the oldest form
of the ancient Egyptian language is rooted in Semitic, and he
prophesied that one day philological science would be astonished

Wo\v6(p0u\no'', the

great Ancestor-god of the dynastic Egyptians.

The

god and the exact pronunciation of his name are not known.
He was said
to be the son of Shu and Tefnut and the grandson of Geb and Nut. He and his wife Isis and
his brother and sister Set and Nephthys, and
his son Horus, were brought forth by Nut at the
same time. He was drowned in the Nile by
Set and suffered mutilation, but he rose from
the dead, and having been declared by the gods
innocent of the charges brought against him by
Set, became King of the Dead and giver of
