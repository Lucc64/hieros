neftś "nephew" (Latin nepōs, nepōtis; this is a cognate of German Neffe, Old Norse nefi)

talitha "girl" (Aramaic)
pera "house" is a false cognate to the Coptic per "house"  WTF!

Latin nominative singular 
fili-us, "son", plural fili-i, dative plural fili-is, but Etruscan 
clan, clen-ar and clen-ar-aśi

Nominative/accusative case 
    No distinction is made between nominative and accusative of nouns. Common nouns use the unmarked root. Names of males may end in -e: Hercle (Hercules), Achle (Achilles), Tite (Titus); of females, in -i, -a, or -u: Uni (Juno), Menrva (Minerva), or Zipu. Names of gods may end in -s: Fufluns, Tins; or they may be the unmarked stem ending in a vowel or consonant: Aplu (Apollo), Paχa (Bacchus), or Turan.
Genitive case 
    There is a patronymic ending: -sa or -isa, "son of", but the ordinary genitive might serve that purpose.
Dative case 
    The dative ending is -si: Tita/Tita-si.[65]
Locative case 
    The locative ending is -θi: Tarχna/Tarχna-l-θi.[70]
Plural number 
    In one case, a plural is given for clan, "son", as clenar, "sons". This shows both umlaut and an ending -ar. Plurals for cases other than nominative are made by agglutinating the case ending on clenar.

Pronouns
mi ("I") and an accusative 
mini ("me / mine")
The second person is uncertain, but some like the Bonfantes have claimed a dative singular une ("to thee") "an-you"
an ("he" or "she") and an inanimate in ("it"). "ON", man

 ca and ta, are used without distinction. The nominative–accusative singular forms are: ica, eca, ca, ita, ta; the plural: cei, tei. There is a genitive singular: cla, tla, cal and plural clal. The accusative singular: can, cen, cn, ecn, etan, tn; plural cnl. Locative singular: calti, ceiθi, clθ(i), eclθi; plural caiti, ceiθi.


Adjectives

Though uninflected, adjectives fall into a number of types formed from nouns with a suffix:

    quality, -u, -iu or -c: ais/ais-iu, "god/divine"; zamaθi/zamθi-c, "gold/golden"
    possession or reference, -na, -ne, -ni: paχa/paχa-na, "Bacchus, Bacchic"; laut/laut-ni, "family/familiar" (in the sense of servant)
    collective, -cva, -chva, -cve, -χve, -ia: sren/sren-cva: "figure/figured"; etera/etera-ia, "slave/servile"

Adverbs
Adverbs are unmarked: etnam, "again"; θui, "now"; θuni, "at first." Most Indo-European adverbs are formed from the oblique cases, which become unproductive and descend to fixed forms. Cases such as the ablative are therefore called "adverbial". If there is any such system in Etruscan, it is not obvious from the relatively few surviving adverbs. ??

Present active
Etruscan used a verbal root with a zero suffix or -a without distinction to number or person: ar, ar-a, "he, she, we, you, they make". <> IR@Egypt

Past or preterite active
Adding the suffix -(a)ce to the verb root produces a third-person singular active, which has been called variously a "past", a "preterite", a "perfect" or an "aorist". In contrast to Indo-European, this form is not marked for person. Examples: 
tur/tur-ce, "gives/gave";  <> DAR!
sval/sval-ce, "lives/lived." *s'VIR ('ed)

Past passive
The third-person past passive is formed with -che: 
mena/mena-ce/mena-che, "offers/offered/was offered". <> manu




ace 
    from Middle English aas, from Old French as, from Latin as, "a whole, a unit, copper coin", possibly Etruscan. As was a Roman coin and was also a unit of weight equal to about one [pound].[1]
antenna 
    from antenna<antemna, "yard-arm, sail." Possibly Etruscan *antithemna>*ant(th)emna from Greek ανάτηθήμένος anatithēmenos, something set up.[2]

arena 
    from arēna "arena"<harēna, "arena, sand"<archaic hasēna<Sabine fasēna, unknown Etruscan word as the basis for fas- with Etruscan ending -ēna.[3]  oro, UR *KURENA <> curir=renna

autumn 
    from autumnus "autumn." Just as Etruscan
 veltha, an earth god, appears as Latin Vola or Olta and is in Voltumna and Vertumnus, 
 so the parallel construction autumnus ought to come from 
Etruscan autu-, related to avil, "year": *av(i)-to-m(e)nos, with loss of the l. There are some names with both l and t: avlethaium, authnal, avtle, and so on, which appear related to autu or auta in Venetic, the idea being that autumn signifies the passing of the year.[4]  TUM:Time!

belt 
    from balteus, "sword belt." The sole connection between this word and Etruscan is a statement by Marcus Terentius Varro that it was of Etruscan origin. All else is speculation.[5] ---
