Many words in the dictionary are not yet fully understood, some of them never will be:  
If you encounter an obscure text in a specific medical magical document, chances are that this word and its connotions are forever lost to history.  

However the number of words which are well understood is overwhelming, and well beyond coincidence. Connections to European languages are not new, however they came into discredit not least because of Nazis abusing and bending the concept of Arian anchestry. Semitic scholars cut pretty much all associations of egyptian and european languages.  
Only recently is the theory of a Eurasian superfamily getting more traction, finding similarities between [proto-indo-european](PIE) and semitic languages.

  crooked 𓆞  𓄿  𓃀𓌳  
clever, ~gewand, buBend  

   quadruple   𓇋  𓆑   𓂧  𓂢  𓏥  
qVdt𓂢?  
1) qV !? maybe already split from early PIE -> fftd 4-drieren ohne q!?  
2) 𓂢 Endung? -don -tion -ate -ieren ok but normally different suffix  
other PIE endings:  
čtyřná.sobný  
čtyřná.sobek  
četvero.struk  
vier.fach vier.mal  
cvaug.vunai  
none of which seems that any similarity to the symbol 𓂢
