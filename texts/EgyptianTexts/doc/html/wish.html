<H1>Wish list</H1>

In the future I would like to extend the software to allow the
following:
<ul>
<li>
If there is a single tier containing hieroglyphic, print
in columns and/or right-to-left if so specified.
Perhaps also hieroglyphic anchored to canvas.
<li>
Improvements to alignment of hieroglyphic and transliteration,
especially where there are gaps in either.
<li>
Implement Home, End, Page Up, Page Down.
<li>
Alignment of transliteration and translation, and of different translations, 
using electronic dictionaries.
<li>
Tutorial in screencast.
<li>
There is some junk code belonging to the old implementation that needs
to be systematically removed or replaced.
<li>
Use Unicode for transliteration internally, with appropriate custom font.
</ul>
If you are a proficient Java programmer and have too much time on your
hands, I will not decline help.
