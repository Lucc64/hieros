<H1>Known bugs</H1>

As applet, the software is reported to run successfully on Konqueror, 
Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, and Epiphany. 
When it does not run on these browsers, it seems to be either
because the available version of Java is older than 1.5, 
or because Java is disabled altogether.
<p>
The following bugs are known:
<ul>
<li>
The 'insert' operator in RES takes too long sometimes, especially
with 'empty' as second argument.
<li>
Automatic alignment is not perfect. There are imperfections
in particular if two tiers do not cover exactly the same
portions of a text.
<li> 
Information on signs in the glyph chooser needs to be completed,
including information on mnemonics.
<li> 
The font size in one window with styled text
sometimes changes if another such window has been opened.
This seems to be a bug in Java. Is there a workaround?
<li> 
I have been informed that the Java plugin of some browsers
cannot find the correct fonts, which may result in the bibliography
or the translations
being printed in the transliteration font.
It is unclear to me what may cause this.
Perhaps because the default font SansSerif is (erroneously!) not available 
in the runtime environment (?)
<li>
I've also received reports that the transliteration font is sometimes not 
loaded, with Firefox on Mac OS X. The behaviour is erratic, and other
applications exhibit similar problems with fonts, which suggests it is 
due to a bug in the Java plugin.
<li>
At rare occasions, the call <tt>layout.getBounds()</tt> in
nederhof.res.Glyphs.getBounds() raises an exception.
I don't have a clue why. The problem is hard to reproduce.
<li>
In the RES Editor, the legend remains minimized upon
switching between KDE desktops. 
This seems to be due to a bug in Java.
<li>
If mouse clicks do not work on a Mac OS X, 
this may be due to bugs in Java distribution 10.6 update 16.
Updating to a newer version has been reported to help.
<li>
Converting RES to EPS causes misplaced signs in new Java distributions, in the
case of mirroring and rotation. 
</ul>
