<H1>Lite format</H1>

Although all textual resources are normally changed through
a graphical user interface, one may also convert back and forth
between XML formats and a plain text format. The latter format one may alter
manually. However, before doing that close the graphical user interface,
to avoid that the file might be overwritten. One should also make sure
that the editor uses UTF-8 as character encoding.
<p>
An example of the 'lite' format 
(equivalent to a corresponding <a href="formats.html">XML format</a>) is:

<pre>
creator = Mark-Jan Nederhof
name = Nederhof
labelname = Ne
created = 2009-08-17
modified = 2009-08-17
version = R
scheme =
language = eng
hieroglyphic = ignored
transliteration = shown
translation = shown
lexical = ignored

This is my translation.

A line consisting of <tt>###</tt> separates header from bibliography and
another separates the bibliography from a sequence of phrases.
Phrases are separated one from the other by an empty line.
Also the respective entries in the bibliography are separated
by an empty line.
<p>
Within a phrase,
the transliteration is separated from the translation by a line containing a
semicolon and nothing else. Coordinates can be abbreviated to strings between
angled brackets, provided such a string contains at least one digit, to
distinguish it from an XML entity. Positions have an extra '@' prepended.
