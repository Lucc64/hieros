<h1>Translation project</h1>

This page offers a tool simplifying
collaborative translation of <b>The Instruction of Ptahhotep</b>.
The discussion is held on the 
<a href="http://www.rostau.org.uk/AEgyptian-L/">AEL email list</a>.

<h2>Participation</h2>

If you want to participate in the translation using this tool, 
and are subscribed to the AEL list, then:
<ul>
<li> download <a href="project.jar">project.jar</a>, 
<li> put it in some otherwise empty folder, 
<li> activate it by clicking on it.
</ul>
This should work on all platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux), 
provided you have Java installed on your machine.
On Linux and Mac OS X you can also run from the command line: 
<tt>java -jar project.jar</tt>.
<p>
The first time you run the tool, you will be asked to provide:
<ul>
<li> the email address with which you're subscribed to the AEL list, 
<li> the password that was distributed through the AEL list,
<li> full name,
<li> short name.
</ul>
The tool will then make local editable copies of the files containing
the hieroglyphic and the initially empty translation.
<p>
To add transliterations and translations for a phrase:
<ul>
<li> Enter edit mode (press <b>Mode</b> under <b>Resource</b>). 
You should now see interlinear text consisting of a number of
"sections", each consisting of four "tiers". 
The first tier is the hieroglyphic, the second tier you
should ignore, and the third and fourth are to contain the 
transliteration and translation.
<li> To add a piece of transliteration/translation (or to modify it), 
click on the preceding green box. This should then become blue.
<li> Press <b>Edit</b> under <b>Resource</b>. 
This should open two text fields at the bottom.
<li> Edit these text fields. If the wrong font appears (transliteration font
should be in the upper field) select the correct font with 
a right mouse click (or Ctrl + mouse click if you don't have a right mouse button).
For the Egyptological alphabet, use <a
href="http://mjn.host.st-andrews.ac.uk/egyptian/standards/transliteration.html">the 
familiar ASCII encoding</a>.
<li> End editing of a phrase by pressing <b>close</b> under <b>Resource</b>.
</ul>
When you are ready to upload your translations, 
press <b>upload</b> under <b>File</b>.
When you're done, close the tool with <b>close</b> under <b>File</b>.
<p>
Further comments:
<ul>
<li>
There is very little point in uploading new translations unless you also 
post the same translations on the AEL list, accompanied by a discussion.
To do this, open the file PtahhotepTrP.txt using any text editor 
(but after closing the project.jar tool), and cut-and-paste the 
relevant lines of translation to your post 
and extend this with further discussion.
<li>
You can also compose translations by manually altering 
the file PtahhotepTrP.txt (once more: after closing the project.jar tool) 
but this is not without risk, and you may end up
corrupting it. Only recommended for techies.
<li>
In any case, make frequent backups of PtahhotepTrP.txt.
<li>
You can add footnotes to transliterations/translations. 
Try a right mouse click on a text field (or Ctrl +
mouse click if you don't have a right mouse button).
Then click on the <b>note</b> marker to type a footnote.
</ul>

<h2>Existing translations</h2>

See existing translations from participants by activating the applet:
<p>
<applet alt="Your browser doesn't seem to understand Java. Ask your system administrator for help."
	codebase="."

	archive="lib/itextpdf-5.4.3.jar"
	width="150" HEIGHT="70">

<p>
(Be patient, this can be slow.)

The Java applet on some Mac OS X machines seems to be broken.
As an alternative, you can browse <a href="text.pdf">the PDF</a>.
This is however not updated frequently.
