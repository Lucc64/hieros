<h1>Manual of Lexicon Editor</h1>

Several lexica may be available, accessible by selecting different tabs.
For a selected lexicon,
one can search in a number of ways, by filling in the fields for
hieroglyphic (not fully functional at this time), for
transliteration, for translation and/or for form. Then one can type
<b>Enter</b> or click the <b>search</b> button.
<p>
One can use Java regular expressions. By default, the typed pattern
is complemented by a following <b>.*</b> so that the emphasis is on
matching a pattern to a prefix of a record. For example, if one
fills in <b>.*ea</b> in the translation field, then this is completed
to <b>.*ea.*</b> so that it would match <b>heaven</b> and <b>great</b>.
<p>
By right-clicking on the first line of a lemma, the Lemma Editor
is opened for that lemma.
