<h1>Manual of Lemma Editor</h1>

A lemma can be edited. The top line consists of the key values.
In most cases, one would only fill in the transliteration ('al'),
translation ('tr') and form ('fo'). Also a position can be filled in.
Positions are used to sort entries to override the
lexicographical ordering. 
<p>
A position can consist of one number, or two 
divided by a non-digit, e.g. a colon. The first number is typically
a page number in a printed dictionary. The second number may help to
order several lemmas on the same page.
<p>
Structural changes to the lemma rely on the 'focus'. 
The focus is indicated by buttons that are gray rather than white. 
The focus is selected by clicking on a button. Clicking a button that
already has the focus removes the focus.
<p>
A lemma consists of zero or more meanings, optionally labelled by a rank.
For each meaning, there are zero or more uses. Each use is defined by a
sequence of other elements, namely hieroglyphic, transliteration, 
translation, form, comment, alternatives ('alt'), and optional alternatives
('opt'). The latter two again consist of zero or more uses.
