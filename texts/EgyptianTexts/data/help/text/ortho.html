<h1>Manual of Orthographic Editor</h1>

A text is divided into words. For each word, there is a sequence of
hieroglyphs and the transliteration. To a selection of
one or more hieroglyphs one
can assign a function. A function can furthermore be linked to a selection
of letters from the transliteration. Most functions have an additional
value. Functions not corresponding to any known reading in the
sign list are printed in red.
<p>
There is always a current word, indicated by a blue box. 
The window also shows a few words before and
after the current word. All editing operations apply to the current word.
One can navigate to another word by clicking on it.
<p>
The editor can be in two modes, viz. annotation mode and split mode.
With the split mode one can divide a text into words. The annotation mode
allows editing functions.

<h1>Buttons in file menu</h1>

The buttons are:

<h2>Close</h2>

Closes the editor.

<h2>Hieroglyphic</h2>

This allows import of hieroglyphic from an existing resource.
Typically one would want to normalize this immediately after importing.
The hieroglyphic editor can be activated by right click on
hieroglyphic text.

<h2>Transliteration</h2>

This allows import of transliteration from an existing resource.
Transliteration can be edited by a right click on a letter of the 
transliteration.

<h1>Buttons in resource menu</h1>

The buttons are:

<h2>Annotate</h2>

Switches to annotation mode.

<h2>Split</h2>

Switches to split mode.

<h2>Meanings</h2>

Opens a window in which meanings of selected glyphs are listed.

<h2>Normalize</h2>

Normalizes the hieroglyphic in the current word, that is, 
the text is flattened (to have one sign per group), mnemonics are
replaced by their Gardiner names, composite signs are
replaced by atomic signs, and sign variants are replaced by
their main representatives.

<h2>Merge</h2>

The current word and the next are merged. (Only in split mode.)

<h2>New word</h2>

A new word is inserted before the current word.

<h2>Append word</h2>

A new word is appended at the end of the text.

<h2>Delete word</h2>

The current word is deleted.

<h2>Word left/right</h2>

Navigate to the previous/next word.

<h2>Glyph left/right</h2>

Navigate selected glyph to the left/right.
In split mode this can be used in combination with a right mouse click,
followed by a number of glyph-left or glyph-right operations, 
followed by another right mouse click to split.
In annotation mode, glyph-left moves the left-most selected glyph to the left,
and glyph-right moves the right-most selected glyph to the right.

<h2>Function left/right</h2>

Move to another function.

<h1>Help</h1>

Opens this window.

<h1>Annotation mode</h1>

One may select one or more hieroglyphs, followed by selection of an associated 
function. Alternatively one may select an existing function. 
Selection of a hieroglyph is by mouse click. A second click unselects a
hieroglyph. After a function is selected, letters of the transliteration may
be selected or unselected. 
<p>
The <b>suggest</b> button suggests possible functions. One may select one of
the proposed functions, or choose another one.
Some functions also offer a text field, which may be edited.
The tab labelled '<b>-</b>' indicates the absence of a function. An existing
function can be removed by selecting this tab.
<p>
There may already be orthographical annotations for the same hieroglyphic and transliteration,
stored in a database. The number of such existing annotations 
is given to the right of the <b>retrieve</b> button.
By pressing this button, the first of these existing annotations is retrieved.

<h1>Split mode</h1>

A mouse click on a hieroglyph splits a segment, with the clicked hieroglyph
becoming the first sign of the next segment. The transliteration is split at the first
letter following a space. If one wants to split at a different point of the
transliteration one should first click on a letter and then on a hieroglyph.

<h1>Keyboard shortcuts</h1>

Instead of clicking on e.g. <b>Close</b> one may also type
<tt>Alt+S</tt>.
Watch the underlined capital letters on the buttons.
<p>
On Mac OS X, the <tt>Command</tt> key must be used instead of the
<tt>Alt</tt> key for menu items.
(The <tt>Command</tt> key is the one with the apple and the four-leaf clover
on it.)
<p>
For the <b>suggest</b> and <b>retrieve</b> buttons the shortcut is
<tt>Alt+G</tt> and <tt>Alt+V</tt>, respectively.
