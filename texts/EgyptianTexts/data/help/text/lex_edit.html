<h1>Manual of Lexical Annotator</h1>

Words in a text are annotated with information pointing
to lemmas (and subentries) in a lexicon, and descriptions
of the particular use in the text.
<p>
The top panel (which may be empty) contains unprocessed hieroglyphic.
The next panel contains the lexical entries.
The bottom panel contains several lexica, one per tab.
<p> 
Navigation in the lexica annotations, is by clicking the frame of one
such annotation, or by the left/right arrow buttons. The currently
focussed lexical entry has a blue border.
<p> 
By clicking on a hieroglyph, all preceding hieroglyphs are split off
and put in the current lexical entry.
By selecting (part of) a lemma, information from a lexicon is
transferred to the current lexical entry.
<p>
For a selected lexicon,
one can search in a number of ways, by filling in the fields for
hieroglyphic (not fully functional at this time), for
transliteration, for translation and/or for form. Then one can type
<b>Enter</b> or click the <b>search</b> button.
<p>
One can use Java regular expressions. By default, the typed pattern
is complemented by a following <b>.*</b> so that the emphasis is on
matching a pattern to a prefix of a record. For example, if one
fills in <b>.*ea</b> in the translation field, then this is completed
to <b>.*ea.*</b> so that it would match <b>heaven</b> and <b>great</b>.
<p>
By right-clicking on the first line of a lemma, the Lemma Editor
is opened for that lemma.
