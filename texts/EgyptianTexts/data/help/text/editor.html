<h1>Manual of Text Editor</h1>

The indexing information includes the main name of a text,
and optionally alternative names that may occur in the indexes.
For each language, there is at most one main name.
If the main name is given in English, the software presently
gives that name preference over main names in other languages.
<p>
Through one or more collections,
one may let the text occur in an index that
gathers texts by for example books or historical persons.
A <i>kind</i> may be e.g. the value <tt>books</tt> or the value
<tt>kings</tt>.
At <i>collect</i> one may enter e.g. the name of a book, or the name of a
king.
The entries for <i>section</i>, <i>subsection</i>, <i>subsubsection</i>
are optional, and may be used to further divide a collection into
subcollections. There is some freedom how these entries
may be used. E.g. <i>section</i> does not have
to be a section number or name but can also be a volume number
or page number.
The left column does not have to be completely filled in,
but e.g. <i>subsubsection</i> should only be used if <i>subsection</i>
is also used.
<p>
Sorting of collections, sections, subsections, etc., is done by extracting
up to three decimal numbers from the entered value. If any such numbers are
equal, the values are compared lexicographically.
When this is not
suitable, for example because the values contain Roman numbers, then
keys in the right column can be entered, which then override
the values in the left column for the purpose of sorting.
Otherwise, the keys can be left blank.

<h1>Buttons in the top menu</h1>

The buttons in the top menu of the text editor are:

<h2>Open</h2>

Opens a text, if none has been opened yet.

<h2>Close</h2>

Closes a text.

<h2>Undo all</h2>

Undoes all edits to values in the window.

<h2>Delete</h2>

Deletes the text from the corpus, but does not delete the text file
or textual resources themselves. If such files are to be removed
from the file system, this must be done manually, rather
than through the graphical user-interface.

<h2>Move</h2>

Moves the text to a different location in the file system.
The textual resources remain in place however.
References from the text to the textual resources are appropriately
updated.

<h2>View</h2>

Opens the textual resources for the text.
