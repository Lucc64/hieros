<h1>Manual of Text Viewer</h1>

This software is used to view and edit philological texts.
Texts are made up of textual resources, plus optionally
alignments between resources. The respective textual resources may
have been developed by different people, and may contain different
types of information. It is generally a good thing to separate
e.g. an hieroglyphic transcription of a text on the one hand
and the transliteration and translation of the same text
on the other hand as separate resources.

<h1>Buttons in file menu</h1>

Not all buttons will be enabled all of the time.
In particular, some buttons are disabled for applets.

<h2>Close</h2>

Closes the viewer.

<h2>Pdf</h2>

Exports the text as PDF file.
Various parameters can be changed, and the target
file can be chosen.

<h1>Buttons in resource menu</h1>

<h2>Close</h2>

Closes an edited phrase, or closes a subpanel with 
viewed or edited properties of a resource.

<h2>Mode</h2>

This toggles between a normal viewing mode to a mode where
phrases in resources can be edited. In edit mode, phrasal
boundaries are explicitly indicated as small green boxes.

<h2>left/right</h2>

In edit mode, the last selection of a symbol is moved left or right.

<h2>Prepend</h2>

In edit mode, prepend new phrase before last phrase that received a mouse click.

<h2>Edit</h2>

In edit mode, edit last phrase that received a mouse click.

<h2>Append</h2>

In edit mode, append new phrase after last phrase that received a mouse click.

<h2>Join</h2>

In edit mode, join last phrase that received a mouse click with the phrase 
following it from the same resource.

<h2>Cut</h2>

In edit mode, cut last phrase that received a mouse click into two phrases.
Preferably, there must be a mouse click in every tier of the resource.

<h2>1-way precedence</h2>

In edit mode, after clicking on two symbols in different tiers, 
the first is constrained to appear to the left of the second.
If the first symbol was clicked on twice, then the precedence refers to the
horizontal position just <i>after</i> that symbol.

<h2>2-way precedence</h2>

As above, but the symbols must be aligned one below the other.

<h2>0 precedences</h2>

Any precedence between two clicked symbols is removed. Precedences are
depicted by blue arrows.

<h2>Auto align</h2>

In edit mode, after clicking symbols from two tiers, the tiers are
automatically aligned. This is provided the implementation offers
alignment for the types of those tiers. Currently supported are:
<ul>
<li> hieroglyphic with transliterations, and
<li> translations or transliterations with 
other translations or transliterations.
</ul>

<h2>No auto align</h2>

Automatic alignment between two tiers is removed.

<h2>Settings</h2>

Properties of rendering can be changed.

<h1>Help</h1>

Opens this window,

<h1>The index pane</h1>

One may add textual resources. Much less frequently, one may want to
add a mapping between two numbering schemes for a text, e.g. if
two different schemes exist for numbering lines in one and the same
manuscript. An added resource may be a new file or an existing file.
<p>
For tiers, one may want to indicate which tiers are to be non-empty
(tick the appropriate boxes). For those that are to be non-empty,
one may also indicate how they are going to be used.
A tier can be: 
<ul>
<li>normally <b>shown</b>, or</li> 
<li>it is taken into account for formatting the other tiers while
it is <b>omitted</b> itself from the output, or</li> 
<li>empty space is left (e.g. for student exercises) 
while the actual tier data is <b>erased</b> from the output.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By the <b>view</b> button, properties of the text can be viewed. 
By the <b>edit</b> button, properties of the text can be edited. 
(The <b>edit</b> button does not appear when the text or the
resources are not editable; this is a matter of file permissions.)
The <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> buttons may be used to change the order
in the text pane. The <b>delete</b> button removes the textual
resource from the text. The corresponding file is not erased from the
file system however; this has to be done manually.
<p>
While editing header or bibliography of a textual resource, do a
right mouse click to see the special fonts and objects that may be
entered.
(A right mouse click can also be obtained by a normal (left) mouse click while
holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> key. This is especially useful on Mac OS X.)

<h1>The text pane</h1>

As mentioned above, the text may be in ordinary viewing mode or
in editing mode. If in editing mode, do a right mouse click to
see whether there are any automatic alignments between tiers.
<p>
When editing a phrase, a right mouse click on the panel shows the special
fonts and objects that can be put in the respective tier of the phrase.
The <b>etc</b> objects can be used in combination with precedence links.
One may connect such a link to an <b>etc</b> object
when there are no suitable symbols for this purpose. The
<b>etc</b> objects are invisible in normal viewing mode.
<p>
A right mouse click on the hieroglyphic in an edited phrase opens a window
for adding footnotes to hieroglyphs. 
(A right mouse click can also be obtained by a normal (left) mouse click while
holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> key. This is especially useful on Mac OS X.)
In that window, first click on a symbol,
and then enter text. The buttons <b>left</b> and <b>right</b>
in the menu can be used to move the position that carries the focus.
The footnote numbered <b>0</b> is a new footnote for the symbol
that is the focus.
The buttons <b>backward</b> and <b>forward</b>
in the menu can be used to move backward or forward
the footnote that has the cursor. This is done only one position
at a time.
<p>
If hieroglyphic that has footnotes is changed by the hieroglyphic
editor, heuristics are applied to maintain the positions of associated
footnotes. 

<h1>Resource viewers</h1>

A resource containing images is shown in a separate window. Such a resource
also contains a list of signs, as separate interlinear tier that is only shown in 
editing mode, when alignment with other tiers can be arranged. 
In viewing mode, one may click on interlinear text, or on an image, 
to scroll to a nearby position in the image or in the interlinear text, respectively.

<h1>Keyboard shortcuts</h1>

Instead of clicking on e.g. <b>Close</b> one may also type
<tt>Alt+C</tt>.
Watch the underlined capital letters on the buttons.
<p>
On Mac OS X, the <tt>Command</tt> key must be used instead of the
<tt>Alt</tt> key for menu items.
(The <tt>Command</tt> key is the one with the apple and the four-leaf clover
on it.)
For buttons, including the buttons
for opening menus in the menu bar,
<tt>Alt</tt> (not <tt>Command</tt>) is used irrespective of platform.
<p>
In text fields, ligatures and special characters 
such as '&szlig;' and '&Ouml;'
can be entered by typing two characters followed by
<tt>Alt+Z</tt>. The conversion table can be made to appear through
<tt>Alt+X</tt>.
On Mac OS X,
use <tt>Command+Z</tt> and <tt>Command+X</tt> instead.
