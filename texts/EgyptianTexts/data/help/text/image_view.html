<h1>Manual of Text/Image Viewer</h1>

One or more images of hieroglyphic text are given.
One can (left) click on a hieroglyph to select it.
<p>
Navigation in an image is in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>By dragging the mouse with the right button.</li>
<li>By dragging the viewport depicted in the diagram above the
image.</li>
<li>By the arrow buttons.</li>
<li>By zooming in/out using the mouse wheel or by
pressing the plus/minus buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the viewer is used next to interlinear text, and if there is 
(automatic) alignment between the image and other tiers, then clicking on a
section of the interlinear text
will show a focus on the first sign in the image that is in the
same section. Conversely, by clicking
on a sign in the image, one causes scrolling of the interlinear text to a
section in which the sign occurs.
