<h1>Manual of prototype administrator (for OCR)</h1>

It is assumed that
a number of prototypes of hieroglyphs are stored in a 
directory. Each such prototype is in a file with a name such as
<b>A1-5.png</b>. The first part of that name is a 
Gardiner name, then a dash, then a number. Only the PNG image
format is allowed. 
<p>
Four modifiers are allowed immediately after the Gardiner name, namely 
<b>[rotate=90]</b>,
<b>[rotate=180]</b>,
<b>[rotate=270]</b>, and
<b>[mirror]</b>.
<p>
It is recommended that different directories are kept for different
hand writings.
<p>
By a right click on a prototype, a prototype is 
removed from the file system.
By a left click, a prototype can be moved to have a different
Gardiner name.

<h1>Buttons in the top menu</h1>

<h2>Open</h2>

Opens a directory with prototypes.

<h2>Close</h2>

Closes the application.

<h2>Prune</h2>

Allows systematic removal of prototypes that are 
very similar, and thereby largely redundant for the purpose
of OCR. The user can specify the maximum number
of prototypes to be kept per hieroglyph.
<p>
This process can take a while. It can be prematurely halted.

<h2>Import</h2>

Allows import of prototypes from an OCR project.
The user can specify the root directory of that OCR
project, and the maximum number of prototypes
to be imported. These will be stored in a directory
called <b>new</b> as subdirectory of the current directory.
<p>
A new instance of the administrator is then opened, in which the
newly import prototypes can be inspected.

<h2>Merge</h2>

Allows two directories of prototypes to be merged. By default,
it will be the <b>new</b> subdirectory being merged 
into the main directory.

<h2>Help</h2>
