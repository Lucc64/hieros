While it's easy to assume that some (if not all) readings of the Egyptian syllables have been run down by the millenia, it's harder to nail down which exactly, and what the original forms might have been. Let's start by going half the way, by looking at modern readings of Greek and Aramaic and their likely original forms.  

We hereby postulate, that  
ε < Σ  
υ < γ  
Ⲩ < r or  
Ⲩ < γ or both  
ϥ < hetha ħ ᵗh ח ᚺᚻ  
ὄ < ס solar > helio > el  
η < hn ⋍ η = 'ə'  
ἡ might be proper h: hemi<semi<δemi>demi (half)  
ἡ might be very soft t/d/c < δ  related to ה = *ᵗh  
γ even today is gj⋍y/dj/sh  

corroboration:  

The Berber signs ⴸ=Δ V=ⵠ gv/dv [[dual]] ⴵ  
The Berber sign [ⵉ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh) = y (Σ silent)  

It is pretty obvious if you look at the form of the characters ε⋍Σ and the greek vocabulary:  

ἑπτά = sἑpta (seven)  
ἑτερό = cetera > heteros > others  
ἑρπετόν = serpent ⋍ ϧⲁⲓⲣⲓ  
Ἑρμῆς Seramis ⇨ Hermes  
ἑτοι ⋍ set=ready  
ἑαυτ ⋍ selbst > self  
ἔρχο < gir = go  
εὖ < gyudh < ἀγαθ , good < agade  
ἐσθί ⇔ cut=eat@...  
ἔσοπτρον ⇔ sceptor (see)  
ἑβδομήκοντα = seve'-time-counte = seventy (70)  
Ἑβραϊ ⋍ Zebra զեբր জেবরা زيبرو  > Cyprid > Hybrid > Hebrew   ⇔  
ὑπέρ *üper super/duper/guper > hyper > über > over  

The only question is *when* did those signs become silent, in which *dialect*?  

Greek already possessing other g and s sound poses no problem:  
1. There might have been different variants of s, just like today we have C⋍s⋍sh⋍ß⋍ś⋍ŝ⋍š⋍ș⋍ş  
2. Likewise we write 'g' for game and giraffe, both different sounds  
3. At the time of Homeric writing *some dialects* might have already swallowed the sounds  

The main difficulty of this theory is that assigning a new value to ε would in consequence result in words, which are unfamiliar to us today, despite the clear connections:  
ἑτερό = cetera  ok with the diacritic mark ἑ≠ε, but  
ετερό in earlier times might consequently have been cetcero (⇔καθαρός?)  
ἑρπετόν = serpẽton > serpent python with diacritics or  
ἑρπετόν = serpeston > serpent pest <?> Karpusteln  

The true pronounciation will forever be unknowable, anyone 'proving' how to correctly pronounce even 1000 year old words is a fool, however we can outline plausible arguments of continuation and similarity, hopefully yielding in *somewhat* close approximations, but all too likely way off.  

The same y <⋍ j <⋍ gj <⋍ 'silent s' shift seems to have occured further east of Greek:  
yetme ⋍ sietm [[seven]]  
үс ⋍ [[third]]  
икенсе ⋍ seconde [[2]]nd  
yal < solo 1  
yüz < sent/cent 100  
yüzmek < swim  (yü < sui)  
yat < Jacht  
yaz < graph  
yaş < geros > years  
yeni < gyn > jeunne  
yeryüzü < jord < Geo* < [[kur]]d  
yür < gir > journey  
evet < si'fait  


Keep in mind that there are and where many sounds/phonemes which are foreign to our ears, and hard for us to produce. https://hooktube.com/watch?v=-zB2TG9sVf8

lets look at the silent component of 'y' (*y*psilon) by modern readings:

чтꙑре = четꙑре = četyre ⋍ quatre = 4  


For some reason the numeral '[[8]]' underwent much corruption
