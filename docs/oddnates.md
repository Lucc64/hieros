In related languages we often have words which have approximately the same consonants but not much other (internal/structural) similarity:  
scapula = Schulterblatt (shoulder blade) ⇔ scalp?  
S-C-P-L ⇔ S-C/H-B-L-D/T  

It is obvious that they were influenced by each other but it is unclear whether they should really be called cognates. In this case they probably should, but in other cases especially in languages which are not closely related the term 'oddnates' might be more appropriate.
