General historical axioms  

* Egypt played a dominant role in an international power-network for over 2000 years  
* The Egyptian culture has strong connections to Semitic, European and African cultures  
* The Egyptian language has strong connections to Semitic, European and African languages  
* The Egyptian language(s) continued to influence other languages from 3500BC to 500AD  
* The (Proto)-Indo-European languages continued to influence other languages from 4000BC  
* The role of [PIE](PIE) in Mesopotamia and Egypt has to be rethought  
* *Independent* innovations are very rare / unlikely :  
* If a technology appears almost simultaneously in two different locations, it has one source  

Linguistic axioms  

* many things can be understood just using the [Alphabet](Alphabet)  
* the words connected with those letters were hyper conserved (changed very little)  
* the words connected with the signs formed conserving, re-converging clusters  
* We mostly follow the [conventional reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration_of_Ancient_Egyptian#Table_of_transliteration_schemes) of the letters  
* With the exception of 'v' letters: 'f' pthn/sn [𓆑](𓆑) vs fE[𓇋](𓇋) 𓅱𓍢  as wə with dangling 'n'  
* For the [Gardinger signs](Gardinger-signs) we use some different readings.  
* By its very nature the pronunciation can always only be a cluster approximation  
* Most [Gardinger signs](Gardinger-signs) assumed to be silent now receive a pronounciation.  
* [Determinants](Determinants) often had a vocalisation which was optional: akin to New York (City).  
* The ultimate reading of some gardener signs is not fully determined  
* Once a European connection is accepted, European suggestions are allowed Pyr⇔Fire [𓍑](𓍑)  
* Most letters had a full (original) reading and an alphabetic one  
* The vowels where mostly lost, the consonants blurred out 𓏏 Delle=tell 𓏏𓏏 dad=tit 𓏏 dough=Teig  
* Some signs had different associated entities  
* All *phonetic* readings should be understood as instantiations of binomial cluster distributions  
* Combinging these distributions can lead to a [wildcard fallacy](wildcard fallacy) {one sign generating all}  
* In two related languages if two words sound similar they are *probably* related somehow  
* The alignment of one word alone is rarely evidence enough  
* The alignment of whole [clusters](mutual-evidence) of words can be prove  
* Deus, Theus and Zeus are related period. Anyone who thinks differently must stop reading  
* The Egyptian language and [Grammar](Grammar) is rather simple.  

mathematical axioms  
* biased estimators can be more precise than a given unbiased one
