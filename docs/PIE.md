[Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) is the consensus Theory in which many of the commonly spoken languages in the world from English to Hindi derive from one pioneering group of 'settlers' who conquered the world with horses some ⋍5000 years ago.  

Here this theory is extended in that 'Proto-Indo-Europeans' did not stop at the gates of Sumeria and Egypt, but that they went straight through them. Either by forming the founding brotherhood of the international elite (which is depicted in Egyptian or Armana letters), or at the very least being in continuous strong contact with the ancient superpowers, leaving tremendous marks on all languages of Eurasia [and Egypt](Highlights).

In other countries the brotherhood of kings formed a superimposed international elite ruling the natives. A queen of [Jiroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiroft_culture) in Iran ⋍3000BC was 1.80 tall with red hair and a golden eye implant.

Ancient Egyptians had little to no genetic kinship with sub-Saharan populations.  
Strikingly, the mummies were more closely related to ancient Europeans and Anatolians than to modern Egyptians. The mummies in the study were of middle-class people, not royalty. "There was no detectable change for those 1,800 years of Egyptian history," Krause said. "The big change happened between then and now."
