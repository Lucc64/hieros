[Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) is the consensus Theory in which many of the commonly spoken languages in the world from English to Hindi derive from one pioneering group of 'settlers' who conquered the world with horses some ~5000 years ago.  

Here this theory is extended in that 'Proto-Indo-Europeans' did not stop at the gates of Sumeria and Egypt, but that they went straight through them. Either by forming the founding brotherhood of the international elite (which is depicted in Egyptian or Armana letters), or at the very least being in continuous strong contact with the ancient superpowers, leaving tremendous marks on all languages of Eurasia [and Egypt](Highlights).

Ancient Egyptians had little to no genetic kinship with sub-Saharan populations.  
Strikingly, the mummies were more closely related to ancient Europeans and Anatolians than to modern Egyptians. The mummies in the study were of middle-class people, not royalty. "There was no detectable change for those 1,800 years of Egyptian history," Krause said. "The big change happened between then and now."

Words of moral, in case someone wants to use this discovery to justify some new Arianism:  

Human beings that need to proof of their superiority are not superior.  
Neccessary or not: The "Brotherhood of man"[𓋊](𓋊)民門 started off very brutally, an international elite dominating not just animals, but also natives. Fortunately they interbred so much, that now most of the planet is indistinguishably related to the founding fathers. After 6000 years and >200 generations it doesn't make much sense to ask about individual anchestry: One has 2^200 ~ 10e60 potential anchestors. If only Hitler knew some basic Math, his Arian theory would fall apart.  

Every one of us is the child of a myriad of suppressors and suppressed likewise.  
Every one of us is the child of a myriad of individuals who were victorious in finding a partner and successfully bearing (and rising) children.  
Every brain of us is filled with the fruits of a myriad who were victorious in refining ideas.
