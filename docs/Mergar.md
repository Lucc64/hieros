While there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and chalcolithic (Copper Age) cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that **the chalcolithic population did not descend from the neolithic** population of Mehrgarh. "...lending credence to the suggested linguistic connection between the Elamite and Dravidic populations." Indians who are lactose-tolerant show a genetic pattern regarding this tolerance which is characteristic of the common European mutation, likely traveling **along the coast of the Persian Gulf** where other pockets of the same mutation have been found. The earliest evidence of **cattle herding** in south Asia comes from the Indus River Valley site of Mehrgarh and is dated to 7,000 YBP. The oldest evidence for the drilling of human teeth in vivo was found in Mehrgarh 7,500 to 9,000 years ago. 

The oldest ceramic figurines in South Asia were found at Mehrgarh. They occur in all phases of the settlement and were prevalent even before pottery appears.
