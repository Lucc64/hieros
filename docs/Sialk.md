Tepe Sialk was an important metal production center in central Iran during the Sialk III and Sialk IV periods.  
Sialk IV level begins in the second half of the fourth millennium with links with the Mesopotamian civilizations of Uruk and Jemdet Nasr. Later on, the material is similar to that of Susa III (Proto-Elamite level)
