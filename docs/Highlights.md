[Proto-Indo-Europeans](PIE) left stong linguistic marks by calling their mothers 'mota' or similar anywhere in the world. Pharaos calling their mother "Mut" is no coincidence as should become clearly evident. Connections to semitic languages are no contradiction: It is easy to understand Old Egyptian as related to both Semitic and Hamitic languages via manifold cultural and actual intermarriages.  

Every single letter in [Alphabet](Alphabet) of Egyptian hieroglyphs left a tremendous linguistic footprint on all surrounding countries.  

But other icons are highly recognizable as well:
