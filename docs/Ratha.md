## Right and Order  

Right and Order are strong Indo-Germanic [[root]]s! ⇔ [[HERD]]/[[RISE]]  

[[Ṛta|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B9%9Ata]] (/ˈrɪtə/; Sanskrit ऋत ṛta "order, rule; truth")

Radja(king,rex) Reiter rider Retter Redelsführer roter Ritter(knight>Knecht [[kar]][[nik]])  
red rod (roter Faden) < [[Radha|https://github.com/pannous/hieros/wiki/Radhamanthys]] < [[cord]]  
[[Ratha|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratha]] < chariot ⇔ [[Kur]][[Rad]]  
Ratha (Proto-Indo-Iranian: *Hrátʰas, Sanskrit: रथ, rátha, Avestan: raθa) is the Indo-Iranian term for a spoked-wheel chariot or a cart of antiquity. Its equivalent term in the Dravidian languages is taer.  

The Indus Valley Civilization sites of Daimabad and Harappa in the Indian subcontinent, there is evidence for the use of terracotta model carts as early as 3500 BC during the Ravi Phase.  

During the Harappan Period (Harappa Phase, 2600–1900 BC) there was a dramatic increase in terracotta cart and wheel types at Harappa and other sites throughout the Indus region. The diversity in carts and wheels shows local refinements of the original bullock-cart invention, which spread very rapidly from it's unknown place of invention from Europe to India.  

Chariot Revolution  
After the invention of the (bit-driven) Chariot from earlier carts and cards, some archaeological force, which is nowadays identified with the 'Aryens' captured the world by storm: They conquered pretty much every country in Eurasia. Their [crusade](Kur) is easy to trace because they had the custom of burying their leaders in huge graves [[Kurgans]] with their gold and their chariots included.  

Egypt was reached by around 1650BC, igniting the [Second Intermediate Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt). The reign of the so called Hyksos Ὑκσώς ([[𓋾]]𓏘𓏮 𓐍𓆼𓋴𓏏𓈉 Herrscher Kr[[𓆼]]st 𓆼=1000 𓐍𓆼𓋴𓏏𓈉<east/foreign < šarg ⋍ 𓐍𓆼𓋴?).  

Their last king Khamudi was expelled from Egypt c. 1550 BC, possibly giving rise to a new stratum in Greek history, bringing the famous mummified golden mask of Minoa, [[Linear-B]] and of course the chariot.  

They associated with the Egyptian storm and desert god, Set, whom they called [s]TarHund. Although some names such as the biblical '[[Jakob]]' are commonly treated as [[Semitic]], new research shows that at least many other names are indeed of typical Indo-European origin:

Four different theories for the spread of Indo-Germanic languages:  
1. Via the early Anatolian Neolithic revolution  
2. Via the Chalcolithic revolution which originated on the Danube around ⋍5500BC, spread to the Caucasus ⋍4200BC and reached much of the rest of Eurasia shortly afterwards.  
3. Via the Chariot revolution starting ⋍2000BC somewhere between the Ural and the Harappan Civilization.

3. Anatolia proto-PIE  
4. Varna/Steppe PIE  
5. Maykop IE?  
6. Global expansion: Egypt, Sumer, Harappan  
7. Chariot Warriors definitely Indo-Germanic
