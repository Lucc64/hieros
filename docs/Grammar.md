Middle Egyptian is an astonishingly simple language, one might even say primitive. Whether this is mostly due to its age, or whether its original simplicity was a devised feature of the written language. At least in later texts the abbreviated words are sometimes spelled out in longer forms.  

Is important to note that alignments between ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages do not contradict alignments between ancient Egyptian and European languages, since both share common roots.  

Even James Allen, the master of projecting plethorae of modern linguistic concepts onto literary a handful of word endings, often remarks its similarity with English.
