The [[Latvian]] languages are renowned among linguists for preserving some features of [[PIE]] especially well.  

Some forms of Egyptian also seem closer to [[Latvian]] than other languages:  

while the word beard '𓐍𓃀𓊃𓅱𓏏𓁸' contains the letters _b__d for beard, the other letters so far were inexplicable.  
The situation looks much less dire in Latgalian:  

𓐍 𓃀 𓊃 𓅱 𓏏 𓁸||beard|< 𓃀𓊃𓅱𓏏⋍𓐍bzvd'⋍buorzda@ Latgalian  𓊃=zad > साथ sāth  

drink 𓋴𓅨𓂋𓇋𓀁 GER.ti  
drink 𓏏𓐍𓈗 dkr/dger ⋍ GERti < Tiger/Tigris?  
dgert ⇔ durst  

to live: Gyventi > GENE ...  
to know:  ism < išmanyti < wis.man.do / wisdom < weise.tun / Waīstun <3 !!!  

𓋳 Garment matches fine 𓋴+[[𓏠]]+𓈖+[[𓏏]], however Latvian offers a different reading:  
𓋳 suknelė : s+gmn+nil < [[𓋴]]+[[𓏠]]+[[𓈖]].  We have yet another totally different order in a similar word  
𓏠𓈖𓐍𓏏𓋳 Mönchskutte? same signs  

These may be puns, dialectic readings, or just different words with the same 'root' letters.
