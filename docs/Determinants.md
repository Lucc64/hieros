Determinants parts of [Nouns](Nouns) which help disambiguation the [Alphabet](Alphabet)ical reading of a word.  

```  
New York 𓊖  
New York City  
```  
Even though they are not always spoken we postulate that they had always one or more phonetic values.  

Most ubiquitous abstract terminal symbol:  
[𓏛](𓏛) 'ter' general terminal symbol for nouns, verbs,etc see  
[𓏥](𓏥) III Terminal symbol for [plural](Plural) nouns, verbs etc see [numbers](Numbers)  
[𓇾](𓇾) Terminal symbol for ‘ter’(terra,terrain) see [𓇿](𓇿)TA/ter, al𓏛TER altair altar  


It is not always evident whether the determinants repeat the foregoing letters or complement them:  

𓍲 𓈖 𓏌 𓏲 [𓁸](𓁸)  
Schnur𓏲Haar  

1) SchnurrHaar = whisker  
2) Schnur Haar = string cord  
3) Schnur := Haar  

Because of this ambiguity it is not always certain what the true reading of a determinant is.  
We have the suspicion that the value of determinants is usually assumed to be known and the letter of proceeding them mostly act as qualifiers:  

[𓄛](𓄛) Tier deer der (leather) :  
*) 𓍋𓃀𓏲𓄛𓏪 L'Banther:  
*) 𓍋𓃀𓏲𓃮 el Panther  
*) 𓍋𓃀𓅱𓃰 El'phanter  

we see how Determinants can also act to *complete* the previous letters.  

𓐍 𓂝 𓅱 𓋴 𓀜 “build” = cons+struck𓀜
