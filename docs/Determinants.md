Determinants parts of [Nouns](Nouns) which help disambiguation the [Alphabet](Alphabet)ical reading of a word.  

```  
New York 𓊖  
New York City

Even though they are not always spoken were postulate that they had always one or more phonetic values.  

It is not always evident whether the determinants repeat the foregoing letters or complement them:  

𓍲 𓈖 𓏌 𓏲 [𓁸](𓁸)  
Schnur𓏲Haar  

1) SchnurrHaar = whisker  
2) Schnur Haar = string cord  
3) Schnur := Haar  

Because of this ambiguity it is not always certain what the true reading of a determinant is.  
We have the suspicion that the value of determinants is usually assumed to be known and the letter of proceeding them mostly act as qualifiers:  

[𓄛](𓄛) Tier deer der (leather) :  
*) 𓍋𓃀𓏲𓄛𓏪 L'Banther:  
*) 𓍋𓃀𓏲𓃮 El Panther  
*) 𓍋𓃀𓅱𓃰 El'Phanter  

we see how Determinants can also act to *complete* the previous letters.  

𓐍 𓂝 𓅱 𓋴 𓀜 “build” = cons+struck𓀜
