As always the original form might have being more complex, and related to jamb jump jambon. However the core of the sign is pretty stable and recognisable:  

Many Egyptian words which have the character '𓃀' now have a 'b' in its derived coptic forms, or similar bh,ph,p sounds in modern variants of the word '𓃀' (all meaning leg~foot)
