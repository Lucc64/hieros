*Traces of Old Egyptian in Eurasian languages*  

To linguists in the 19th centuries it came as a revelation when they discovered that the old Persian and Sanscrit words for family members were virtually identical to [European](PIE) variants:  

cuneiform|transcribed|english|letters  
--|--|--|--  
𐎶𐎠𐎫𐎠			|MaTa 	|mother  |𐎶=M 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎱𐎡𐎫𐎠			|PiTa	|father  |𐎱=P 𐎡=I 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎲𐎼𐎠𐎫𐎠		|BraTa	|brother |𐎲=B 𐎼=R 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
*𐎯𐎧𐎬𐎠		|Duxtua	|daughter  
𐎱𐎢𐏂			|Pučun  | puer/son  

Even now, 2500 years after Persians hammered those words into stone, the Iranian(Farsi) words are almost identical, surviving an Arabian conquest and millenia of separation, but reinforced by international relationships and intermarriages:  

Farsi|transcribed|english

مامان 	|mâmân 	|mother  
مادر 	|mâdar 	|mother(formal)  
بابا 	|bâbâ 	|father  
پدر 	|pedar 	|father(formal)  
برادر   |barâdar|brother  
دختر 	|doxtar |daughter

This (re)discovery lead to well established theories of [proto-indoeuropean](PIE) expansions. Here we investigate the relationship between these [pioneers](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) and the Pharaonic Egyptian language and culture.  

First we take a step back to the region where the PIE journey began:  
The countries surrounding the black sea.

In 5000BC the **Danube [Vinča civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture)** pioneered advanced copper technology, in 4200BC Romanian [Varna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_culture) hordes contain more gold artefacts than all other sites of that time combined, turning a formerly egalitarian society into a more violent one lead by an **elite**.

One important bridgehead of the urban formation period was [Tell Zeidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Zeidan) south of the Caucasus. In the last decade the scolary opinion has flipped the signs in that now it is believed that Sumerian technology came from the north. (Kingship came from the mountains according to Sumerian tradition).  

Only recently has the caucasian [Maykop culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture) been redated to begin about 4000BC. As it contains more gold and artefacts from Sumer than the whole rest of Mesopotamia, its central position in the formation of urbanization becomes more and more evident. Their [kurgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan) mounts, some still reaching over 50 meters height, can be seen as predecessors of Egyptian, [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepe_Sialk) and [Peruvian pyramids](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caral), which appeared some thousand years later. Central to this revolution were a bag of inventions, including *metallurgy*, *brewing*, proto-*writing*, *kingship* and the ***sail*** boat, which became a cult object in the [Ubaid period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period) - 3800BC. The horse|donkey|bull**cart** appeared about the same time. This [Curgan Copper Conquest](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) reached Egypt comparatively late, though one of its watermarks, industrial brewing, can be found as early as 3700BC. This new dramatic wave reached remote China a thousand years later, the real push there came with the chariots.  

The roots of the Persian language came via the region of Elam with its capital Susa on the eastern border of Sumeria. Strikingly the cultural artefacts of Egypt and Susa were nearly identical:  

![susa-egypt.png](susa-egypt.png)  
Near identical building plans of the early temples and very similar early Egyptian and Sumerian [ceremonies](Hieros-gamos) clearly demonstrate that these are not mere trade-artefacts, but in fact proof of a common anchestry of both higher civilizations.  

In in Jiroft, south Iran, a 5000 year old woman with a golden eye implant was [discovered](http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Iran_s_Burnt_City.htm). With an outstanding 1.82 m tall (6 feet) she was much taller than ordinary women of her time (⋍3000BC). We anticipate that genetic tests will show that she was indeed part of the proto-indo-european founding stock.  

Some context of this urbanization can be explored in the paper the [Kurgan Copper Revolution](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution)  

If nothing else the little introduction above demonstrates how well the world was connected even before the building of the pyramids. Proto-indo-europeans are sometimes treated as if they stopped at the gates of the superpowers of the time (Sumeria, Susa and Egypt) and had little or nothing to do with its elite. Nothing could be further from the truth.  

Here we investigate how deeply the roots go and how the Egyptian system, its [cosmology](cosmos) and language are intertwined with our own:  

The Egyptian Hieroglyphic writing system started as a syllabary[➾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary) but soon converged to a rather small set of frequent signs and sounds plus [determinants](Determinants) (like [𓈉](𓈉) for land).  

One of the most recognizable letters is '𓃀' with the phonetic value 'b':  

Babylon is written [𓃀](𓃀)[𓃀](𓃀)[𓂋](𓂋)[𓏤](𓏤)[𓈉](𓈉) b.b.l.[1](Numbers)(𓈉land) (or b.b.r)  

Using the conventional Egyptian [alphabet](Alphabet) in its late form, which is preserved to us by comparisons with the derived coptic and demotic languages, as well as comparisons to greek and semitic languages.  

We subscribe to the idea that central words of frequent use and large semantic clusters have a much lower probability of mutating then other words, similar to ultra-conserved genes. Especially if they are codefied as those words that had a glyph of their own.  

(The mnemonics can be ignored if knowledge German is absent)

With this alphabet, which linguist deciphered 200 years ago, and which only received minor modifications since then, we can start to decipher words:  

[𓆤](𓆤) [𓃀](𓃀)[𓇋](𓇋)[𓅱](𓅱)[𓆤](𓆤)𓏨  [𓃀](𓃀)=b [𓇋](𓇋)=i/e [𓅱](𓅱)=[𓍢](𓍢) bee  

One cognate match might be coincidence, especially one with so few syllables, a whole cluster of words hints at connections which need refreshed investigations:  

[𓄝](𓄝) is usually transcribed as #st and has the following usages:  
𓋴 𓄝 𓏏 𓏏 [𓁐](𓁐) Satis (goddess)  S+𓄝+t+t(h)  
𓋴 𓄝 𓏏 𓌕 𓂡 shoot  s+𓄝+t

𓅱 𓋴 𓈙 𓏏 𓈗 urine : 1. wasshed ⇔ water 2. us-shit (aus-scheid / aus-schütten)  
[𓈗](𓈗) 𓇋 𓇋 𓏏 𓈗  urine שֶׁתֶ schütten  => 𓈗=sea?  𓈗=𓅱𓋴𓈙 Wasser w.s.sh'

Sumerian / akkadian cuneiform is notorious for having sometimes half a dozen readings for a single sign. Fortunately in Egyptian there are fewer signs with ambiguous readings, which makes interpretation much less arbitrary, and much less [error](𓌳)-prone.  

It is impossible to reconstruct the exact phonetic reading, which probably varied within dialects and centuries, so all we can do is align the consonant letters with their cognates:

Is this all a German hoax from the 19th century? The alphabet and the standard reading of signs were developed by French, English and Semitic scolars, so it all seems genuine.  

This Discovery is not entirely new, Dr. Christian De Vartavan, head of the Armenian Egyptology Centre released several [papers](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiA0MjT2dDYAhUEJlAKHa-8C0MQFggzMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academia.edu%2F357726%2FSeveral_Ancient_Egyptian_numerals_are_cognates_of_Indo_European_or_Proto_Indo_European_equivalents&usg=AOvVaw0RUWGKPhtGirffrH_29yU6) on the subject. In fact this observation was more widely spread before the second world war, after which it became taboo. Either because the Nazis abused the Indo-Europaen data for their ideology, or because of the undeniable strong connections between Egyptian and Semitic languages; the later however is not a contradiction:  

Egyptian could be related to Afro-Asiatic *and* Eurasian languages.  

Once it is accepted there is that there is a connection between Egyptian and European languages, we can postulate that '𓃀' b belongs to the ultra-preserved European 'pod'-cluster (all meaning 'leg'):  

𓃀 b  
پَا‎ pā (persian)  
pod (greek) ⇔ boot, feet  
la pierna (spanish)  
láb  (hungary)  
lab⋍leg (english)  
Bein  (german)  
b 𓃀  

At this stage it is too early to assess which of the European cognates matches best the Egyptian variant.  
And when exactly was 𓃀 read as something similar to Bein, pierna, pā, pod, 𒉽𒄬, PapHalf, PaDemi, 𒁇 bar par, 𒈦 ban … ?  

1) during the [formation period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Group_culture) as suggested above  
2) constantly as one reading among several  
3) constantly as the main reading  
4) reinterpretation of the glyphs at the hyksos invasion?  
5) christian religion (re-reading / re-alliance)?  

Given the antiquity of sanskrit and its astonishing similarity to western languages, all seem possible.  

The influence of written letters on spoken vernacular has probably been underestimated.  
Ever repeating recitations can shift whole languages.  

Remember the persian words for mother and father?  
Here are the (deified) Egyptian variants:  

Because the original phonetics are impossible to reconstruct, the suggested reading must be consumed with salt (though not arbitrairy).

Crazy, but possible. If nothing else a fabulous mnemonic which makes Egyptian more accessible than most other languages. In fact giving its relative simplicity in [Grammar](Grammar) and it's central position in the language families every student of linguistics should learn it. Egyptian is riddled with [puns](puns), making formal analysis at times difficult, but not less accessible.  

… common expression:  [𓅭](𓅭)[𓇳](𓇳) sA'Ra = ★sonray = son of the sun  

Egyptologists followed the path of the lowest common denominator, with the bizarre result that quite a few words are reduced to mere sequences of vowels, i.e. [𓂣](𓂣)[𓉻](𓉻)[𓄿](𓄿) = a.a.a  (magnify)  
Similarily we reject that the four signs [𓇋](𓇋)=(f)e 𓏏=t 𓆑=v 𓀀 should be reduced to a mere 'it' as in some modern dictionaries.  

This obviously needs further work, but the case of [Determinants](Determinants) should be reopened.  

In the past linguists focussed on demonstrating that Semitic languages are the mothers of Egyptian. In the future it should be reexamined whether some fathers came from further north. Even before the arrival of the charriot.  

For the German cognate  
[𓆣](𓆣) K-p-r-r [𓐍](𓐍)[𓊪](𓊪)[𓂋](𓂋)𓂋𓆣  ⋍Käfer (beetle)  
a less corrupted, more original reading probably is:  
[𓐍](𓐍)[𓊪](𓊪)[𓂋](𓂋)𓂋  Cr-bh-𓂋-r [scarabae](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skarab%C3%A4us)r  (𓐍 as CIRcle not "Kh" )  

With cognate [cluster analysis](cluster analysis) this becomes plausible.  

In order to accept a deep relationship which goes beyond lexical interbreeding, one needs to study the [Grammar](Grammar). It seems surprisingly compatible with Indo European. No feature of the grammar forbids a common ancestry, many similarities corrobate one.
