*Traces of Old Egyptian in Eurasian languages*  

To linguists in the 19th centuries it came as a revelation when they discovered that the old Persian and Sanscrit words for family members were virtually identical to [European](PIE) variants:  

cuneiform|transcribed|english|letters  
--|--|--|--  
𐎶𐎠𐎫𐎠			|MaTa 	|mother  |𐎶=M 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎱𐎡𐎫𐎠			|PiTa	|father  |𐎱=P 𐎡=I 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎲𐎼𐎠𐎫𐎠		|BraTa	|brother |𐎲=B 𐎼=R 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
*𐎯𐎧𐎬𐎠		|Duxtua	|daughter  
𐎱𐎢𐏂			|Pučun  | puer/son  

Even now, 2500 years after Persians hammered those words into stone, the Iranian(Farsi) words are almost identical, surviving an Arabian conquest and millenia of separation, but reinforced by international relationships and intermarriages:

This (re)discovery lead to well established theories of [proto-indoeuropean](PIE) expansions. Here we investigate the relationship between these [pioneers](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) and the Pharaonic Egyptian language and culture.  

First we take a step back to the region where the PIE journey begun: The countries surrounding the black sea.

In 5000BC the **Danube [Vinča civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture)** pioneered advanced copper technology, in 4200BC Romanian [Varna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_culture) hordes contain more gold artefacts than all other sites of that time combined, turning a formerly egalitarian society into a more violent one lead by an **elite**.

Only recently has the caucasian [Maykop culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture) been redated to begin at 4000BC. As it contains more gold and artefacts from Sumer() than the whole rest of Mesopotamia, its central position in the formation of urbanization becomes more and more evident. Especially as it connects our [European roots](PIE) with the two great civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Their [kurgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan) mounts, some still reaching over 50 meters height, can be seen as predecessors of Egyptian, [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepe_Sialk) and [Peruvian pyramids](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caral), which appeared some thousand years later. Central to this revolution were a bag of inventions, including *metallurgy*, brewing, proto-*writing*, *«kingship»* and the ***sail*** boat, which became a cult object in the [Ubaid period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period) -3800BC. The horse/donkey/bull *cart* appeared about the same time. This [Curgan Copper Conquest](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) reached Egypt comparatively late, though one of its watermarks, industrial brewing, can be found as early as 3700BC.  

The roots of the Persian language came via the region of Elam with its capital Susa on the eastern border of Sumeria. Strikingly the cultural artefacts of Egypt and Susa were nearly identical:  

![susa-egypt.png](susa-egypt.png)  
Near identical building plans of the early temples and very similar early Egyptian and Sumerian [ceremonies](Hieros-gamos) clearly demonstrate that these are not mere trade-artefacts, but in fact proof of a common anchestry of both higher civilizations.  
Some context of this urbanization can be explored in the paper the [Kurgan Copper Revolution](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution). Here we investigate how deeply the roots go and how the [system](PIE), its [cosmology](cosmos) and language are intertwined with our own:  

Remember the persian words for mother and father?  
Here are the (deified) Egyptian variants:

Using the conventional Egyptian [alphabet](Alphabet) in its late form, which is preserved to us by comparisons to the derived coptic and demotic languages, as well as comparisons to greek and semitic languages.  

We subscribe to the idea that central words of frequent use and large semantic clusters have a much lower probability of mutating then other words, similar to ultra-conserved genes. Especially if they are codefied as those words that had a glyph of their own.

In general one should think of those signs as distributions, so 𓃀 is somewhere on the axis p-ph-bh-b-pf-f, the exact pronunciation was probably dependent on dialects and words. The german Bein for '𓃀' conveniently lives in the middle of this distribution, the original reading could have been closer to spanish pierna.  

Fortunately well recognisable words and clusters make the situation less dire than it would seem.  

The Egyptian Hieroglyphic writing system started as a syllabary[➾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary) but soon converged to a rather small set of frequent signs and sounds plus [determinants](Determinants) (like [𓈉](𓈉) for land).  

Babylon is written [𓃀](𓃀)[𓃀](𓃀)[𓂋](𓂋)[𓏤](𓏤)[𓈉](𓈉) b.b.l.[1](Numbers)(𓈉land) (or b.b.r)  

But other words and icons are recognizable as well:  

[𓆤](𓆤) Biene [𓃀](𓃀)[𓇋](𓇋)[𓅱](𓅱)[𓆤](𓆤)𓏨  [𓃀](𓃀)=b [𓇋](𓇋)=i/e [𓅱](𓅱)=[𓍢](𓍢)  

One cognate match might be coincidence, a whole cluster of words might hint at connections which need refreshed investigations:

This Discovery is not entirely new, Dr. Christian De Vartavan, former head of the Armenian Egyptology Centre released several [papers](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiA0MjT2dDYAhUEJlAKHa-8C0MQFggzMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academia.edu%2F357726%2FSeveral_Ancient_Egyptian_numerals_are_cognates_of_Indo_European_or_Proto_Indo_European_equivalents&usg=AOvVaw0RUWGKPhtGirffrH_29yU6) on the subject. In fact this observation was more widely spread before the second world war, after which it became taboo. Either because the Nazis abused the Indo-Europaen data for their ideology, or because of the undeniable strong connections between Egyptian and Semitic languages; the later however is not a contradiction:  

Egyptian could be related to Afrosemitic *and* Eurasian languages.  

In the past linguists focussed on demonstrating that Afrosemitic languages are the mothers of Egyptian.  
In the future it should be reexamined whether the fathers came from further north. Even before the arrival of the charriot.
