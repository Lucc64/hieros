*Traces of Old Egyptian in Eurasian languages*  

To linguists in the 19th centuries it came as a revelation when they discovered that the old Persian and Sanscrit words for family members were virtually identical to [European](PIE) variants:  

cuneiform|transcribed|english|letters  
--|--|--|--  
𐎶𐎠𐎫𐎠			|MaTa 	|mother  |𐎶=M 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎱𐎡𐎫𐎠			|PiTa	|father  |𐎱=P 𐎡=I 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎲𐎼𐎠𐎫𐎠		|BraTa	|brother |𐎲=B 𐎼=R 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
*𐎯𐎧𐎬𐎠		|Duxtua	|daughter  
𐎱𐎢𐏂			|Pučun  | puer/son  

Even now, 2500 years after Persians hammered those words into stone, the Iranian(Farsi) words are almost identical, surviving an Arabian conquest and millenia of separation, but reinforced by international relationships and intermarriages:

This (re)discovery lead to well established theories of [proto-indoeuropean](PIE) expansions. Here we investigate the relationship between these [pioneers](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) and the Pharaonic Egyptian language and culture.

In 5000BC the **Danube [Vinča civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture)** pioneered advanced copper technology, in 4200BC Romanian [Varna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_culture) hordes contain more gold artefacts than all other sites of that time combined, turning a formerly egalitarian society into a more violent one lead by an **elite**.

Only recently has the caucasian [Maykop culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture) been redated to begin at 4000BC. As it contains more gold and artefacts from Sumer() than the whole rest of Mesopotamia, its central position in the formation of urbanization becomes more and more evident. Especially as it connects our [European roots](PIE) with the two great civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Their [kurgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan) mounts, some still reaching over 50 meters height, can be seen as predecessors of Egyptian, [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepe_Sialk) and [Peruvian pyramids](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caral), which appeared some thousand years later. Central to this revolution were a bag of inventions, including *metallurgy*, brewing, proto-*writing*, *«kingship»* and the ***sail*** boat, which became a cult object in the [Ubaid period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period) -3800BC. The horse/donkey/bull *cart* appeared about the same time. This [Curgan Copper Conquest](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) reached Egypt comparatively late, though one of its watermarks, industrial brewing, can be found as early as 3700BC.  

The roots of the Persian language came via the region of Elam with its capital Susa on the eastern border of Sumeria. Strikingly the cultural artefacts of Egypt and Susa were nearly identical:  

![susa-egypt.png](susa-egypt.png)  
Near identical building plans of the early temples and very similar early Egyptian and Sumerian [ceremonies](Hieros-gamos) clearly demonstrate that these are not mere trade-artefacts, but in fact proof of a common anchestry of both higher civilizations.  
Some context of this urbanization can be explored in the paper the [Kurgan Copper Revolution](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution). Here we investigate how deeply the roots go and how the [system](PIE), its [cosmology](cosmos) and language are intertwined with our own:  

Remember the persian words for mother and father?  
Here are the Egyptian variants:

Using the egyptian [alphabet](Alphabet) in its late form, which is preserved to us by comparisons to the derived coptic and demotic languages, as well as comparisons to greek and semitic languages.  
The Egyptian Hieroglyphic writing system  started as a syllabary[➾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary) but soon converged to a rather small set of frequent signs&sounds plus «determinants» (like [𓈉](𓈉) for land).  

Babylon is written [𓃀](𓃀)[𓃀](𓃀)[𓂋](𓂋)[𓏤](𓏤)[𓈉](𓈉) b.b.l.[1](Numbers)(𓈉land)  
'L' 𓂋 «lense» «el'lips» is normally read as  
'R' 𓂋 «round»  («rot» = mouth in Russian = the meaning of the sign)  

Barbarion or not, the Egyptian letter 'b' [𓃀](𓃀) looks almost like a flipped modern 'b' in writing (both writing directions were common initially). The word '𓃀' itself is cognate with [european](PIE) variants: Bein, pierna, pod, foot, …  

Every single letter in this “[Alphabet](Alphabet)” of Egyptian hieroglyphs left a tremendous linguistic footprint on most surrounding and quite distant extinct and extant languages

This Discovery is not entirely new, Dr. Christian De Vartavan, former head of the Armenian Egyptology Centre released several [papers](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiA0MjT2dDYAhUEJlAKHa-8C0MQFggzMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academia.edu%2F357726%2FSeveral_Ancient_Egyptian_numerals_are_cognates_of_Indo_European_or_Proto_Indo_European_equivalents&usg=AOvVaw0RUWGKPhtGirffrH_29yU6) on the subject. In fact this connection was much more widely spread before the second world war, which partly explains why it has been a taboo since then. Another reason were the undeniable strong connections to Semitic languages; this however is not a contradiction:  

Egyptian had a big influence on Semitic, African *and* European languages.  

The most important sign of early urbanizers was probably
