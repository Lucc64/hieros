Egypt seems to have had an affinity to MW NV sounds.  
The most prominent example is Mwt Mutter Mother.  

If one follows the [main premise](Home) of this page, other examples would be  
[𓏇](𓏇) mi : wie  
[𓅱](𓅱) me / we ( 1.st singular)  
[𓅓](𓅓) mu / Wū 乌   beware of the [wildcard fallacy](wildcard fallacy) though,  
[maat](Maat) wahrheit  
[𓅓](𓅓) mi mit : with  
[𓌴](𓌴)[𓁹](𓁹)𓄿𓄿 [moye](Moye)r voyer (over)see 目见 mùjiàn ...  

except for the Mwt Mutter those examples could also be a sound change.  
The example mit ⇔ with shifts this question to the Germanic branches: whether there was a root wmit mwit or a sound change, or something in between (a very soft mh).  
If one accepts [𓁹](𓁹) as moyge : mögen make the split is with french voyer voir faire. (see to it)  

In the not unlikely case that this question was already answered please open a [ticket](https://github.com/pannous/hieros/issues)  

especially as there is a [mwn](mwn) affinity as well  
𓅱 un ¬  
𓅱 mei ¬  
𓅱 wu ¬  
𓅓 burd bu ¬  
𓅓 apo ¬
