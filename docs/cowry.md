ìÜ© **Cowry**  

Used to make beads for at least 9,000 years, initially used as ornamentation, rather than as money.  

Shells were the first (known) money used by the [[PIE]]oneers; they were durable, difficult to forge and had a limited supply.  

Archaeological evidence indicates that people in Neolithic Europe were trading the shells of *Spondylus* gaederopus to make spindles, bangles and other ornaments throughout much of the Neolithic period. The Linear Pottery Culture worked them into bracelets and belt buckles. The main use period appears to have been from around 5350 to **4200 BC**, especially in [[Varna]]. Afterwards the use of Spondylus in grave goods appears to have been limited to women and children: Presumably metal based money took its place, maybe button **seals** and lapis lazuli and glazed faience **beads**<<. The shells were harvested from the Aegean Sea, but were transported far into the center of the continent. Coins where invented late in Lydia about 600BC in the form of electrum (green/white gold) turtle Áî≤ or [[quadriga]] coins with [[swastika]] hammer pattern. The idea reached India around 500BC.   

The [Harappa](Mergar) (Indus) Civilization turned the Maledives into a cowry 'mint' which lasted until last century. See Mercury below.  

 Starting over three thousand years ago, cowry shells, or copies of the shells, were used as Chinese currency. The Classical Chinese character for "money/currency" [Ë≤ù](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%B2%9D) originated as a pictograph of a cowrie shell. See [[oracle script]]  

Cowries were formerly used as means of exchange in India. In Bengal, where it required 3840 to make a rupee, the annual importation was valued at about 30,000 rupees.  
In Southeast Asia, when the value of the Siamese tical (baht) was about half a troy ounce of silver, the value of the cowrie (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢ bia) was fixed at ‚Äã1‚ÅÑ6400 Baht (80*80 ventrisimal [[numbers]]) Kaudi ‚áî Geld?  

Ecuadorian peoples traded them with peoples as far north as present-day Mexico and as far south as the central Andes.[9] The Moche people of ancient Peru regarded the sea and animals as sacred; they used Spondylus shells in their art and depicted Spondylus in effigy pots.[10] Spondylus were also harvested from the Gulf of California and traded to tribes through Mexico and the American Southwest.  

Spondylus limbatus was commonly ground for mortar in Central America; Some Mediterranean species are edible and, in particular S. gaederopus, is commonly consumed in Sardinia.  

In Papua New Guinea, cowry shells are still legal **currency** as Keena.
