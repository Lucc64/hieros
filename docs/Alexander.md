Ἀλέξανδρος (Aléxandros), from ἀλέξω (aléxō, “I defend”) + ἀνδρ- (andr-), the stem of ἀνήρ (anḗr, “man”).  

Might be a word with 100 etymologies and connotations.  

No proof, just a suspicion, giving his extreme importance to this story and the fact that many things have been reinterpreted (not all Alexandrias where founded by Alexandre the great)  

And given the central importance of the root N-T-R to egyptian cults 𓊹 𓈖𓏏𓂋𓏯𓅐 center ㊥
