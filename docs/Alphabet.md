These are the most frequent signs of the hieroglyphics ordered by the modern roman alphabet. For the complete sign list see [[Gardinger signs]].  

We mostly follow the [conventional reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration_of_Ancient_Egyptian#Table_of_transliteration_schemes)  
 of the signs, with the exception of letter 'f' pth [[𓆑]] vs [[𓇋]]e.

Even in its early form, the Egyptian hieroglyphics system was 'almost alphabetic'. A quite small and easy to learn system of syllables, at least compared to Chinese.  
The exact phonetic values are impossible to reconstruct, but comparative linguistics can give estimates for the dominant dialects. Even at the time when this language was still spoken most letters were clusters of similar sounds (see different values of 'a' in 'man','made','master',…)  
For example many Egyptian words which have the character '𓃀' now have a 'b' in its derived coptic forms, or similar bh,ph,p,v,f sounds in modern variants of the word '𓃀' (all meaning ~leg)  

* Bein | German  
* pāy, padistān | Persian  
* paþ[LUL] | Sumerian  
* pod | Greek  
* láb “leg, foot” | Hungarian  
* ⲫⲁⲧ | Coptic  
* Fuß | German  

Likewise 𓏏 blurred into a spectrum from D, DT, DH, T, TH, S  

There is a huge cluster of hundreds of derive related words in many languages (pedestrian,𐀴 𐀪 𐀷 𐀆  (ti-ri-po-de = tripod Linear A), …,)  

Dr. Christian De Vartavan did a fantastic job reconstructing the pronunciation of the late stage of Egyptian. We take a somewhat different approach and try to reconstruct the early/middle forms of the signs when they were optionally readable as Complete Words, before they were reduced to syllables and phonemes.  
It is admitted and obvious that the consensus mechanism went a bit too far: many words in dictionaries are reduced to the common denominator and just sequences of vowels a-a-a, etc. Thus while it is custom to treat determinants as silent signs, we treat them mostly as voiced infixes / suffixes.  

A modern pendant would be:  
New York [[𓊖]][[𓏏]]𓏤  
New York City  

In some cases both approaches seem legitimate, in others it seems more natural to include the suffix:  

* 𓍋[[𓃀]][[𓏲]][[𓄛]][[𓏪]] L'Ban[[ther]]  
* 𓍋𓃀𓅱𓃰 El'Phan(ter)  
* 𓍋𓃀𓏲𓃮 El Panther
