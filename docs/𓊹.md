This artefact from the Danube [Boian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boian_culture) 4300–3500 BC might seem boring to the modern eye. But such a geometric symbolic object was a novelty appearing in a world which was still dominated by hunter gatherers and neolithic farmers. The 𓊹 symbol on it could easily be rejected as coincidence if it wasn't for the trace of the unbeloved [swastika](swastika) symbol, which also spread from the Danube to Sumer, Indus and beyond.  

Although Egypt is renowned to be polytheistic, we often find text which just reference "the [God](𓊹)". Other times we find collections of praises such as [𓎟](𓎟)𓂋𓐍𓏜 “All Wiss[ender](𓊹)”, “All Rechter”, “[All](All) Reckoner”, “All X[ander](𓊹)”...
