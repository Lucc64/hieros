Aeneas Sage tale: Virgil's Aeneid
The Aeneid explains that Aeneas is one of the few Trojans who were not killed or enslaved when Troy fell.
He was the progenitors of Romans.

This is corroborated by connections between [[Luwian]] and [[Etruscan]] 

The phonology of Etruscan is known through the alternation of Greek and Etruscan letters in some inscriptions (for example, the Iguvine Tablets), and many individual words are known through loans into or from Greek and Latin, as well as explanations of Etruscan words by ancient authors. A few concepts of word formation have been formulated (see below). Modern knowledge of the language is incomplete. 

[Etruscan mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_mythology)

### Etrusca Disciplina
Libri Haruspicini, containing the theory and rules of divination from animal entrails**  
Libri Fulgurales, describing divination from lightning strikes;   
Libri Acherontici, dealing with the hereafter;  
Libri Ostentaria, containing rules for interpreting prodigies.  
Libri Rituales.  : prophetess Vegoia in the Libri Vegoici at Vigian?  
Libri Tagetici   The revelations of the prophet Tages pavatarchies at Tarquinia/Tuscania/Etroys  
Libri Fatales, detailing the religiously correct methods of founding cities and shrines, draining fields, formulating laws and ordinances, measuring space and dividing time;

Divination was undertaken in Roman society by priestly officials called haruspices. Political officials also, such as the augures, lituus, the crooked staff of the augur

Cicero on auspices: we run the risk of committing a crime against the gods if we disregard them, or of becoming involved in old women's superstition if we approve them.
Who could suppose that **frogs** had this foresight? And yet they do have by nature some faculty of premonition, clear enough of itself, but too dark for human comprehension.  

pavatarchies / avl tarchunus

### Tarchis

Tages' recorded response is "in ancient letters", presumably in the Etruscan language. Lydus says it is not very understandable, and that he relies on translations. 

Winged figures, representing divinity, are also common, especially on funerary urns from Tarquinia (CorNeto)
there appears to be no standard way to depict Tages. Art historians have inserted Tages freely among them but entirely in a speculative fashion.

The Etruscans, as evidenced by the inscriptions, used several words: capen (Sabine cupencus), maru (Umbrian maron-), eisnev, hatrencu (priestess). They called the art of haruspicy ziχ neθsrac. 
Carsthien? really? Carthago!

It was ruled by Aita, and the deceased was guided there by Charun, the equivalent of Death, who was blue and wielded a hammer. The Etruscan Hades was populated by Greek mythological figures and a few such as Tuchulcha, of composite appearance. 

Heiden ~ **Hades** h**Aita**r Osir 𓊨𓁹𓀭 Seer Vaides!!!   
Aitas wife is **Persipnei**, the Etruscan equivalent to the Greek **Persephone**, Hades wife  

On one ash urn appears humanized Aita, bearded and fur-capped, about to lead away into the Underworld the man whose ashes were inside the box, and whose spirit is seen on the outside passing through the portal to the world beyond. He wears the pointed metal cap of a haruspex (Horusphex), a **seer**.[4]

The Charon of Vergil in the Aeneid is particularly cruel; "Vergil's Charon is not only the Greek ferryman of Aristophanes [in The Frogs], but a torturing death-devil, no ferryman at all."

possession of a torch, key, or scroll, and she is shown often to be bare-chested with cross-straps across her breast, adorned with fur boots, a rolled short chiton, and sometimes with unattached sleeves. In fact her dress has been attributed by Scheffer as specifically the dress of a huntress.
interpreted as a goddess of fate (thus scroll)
common types associate her presence with occasions of slaughter and murder, including scenes from the Trojan cycle. Occasionally she is shown rising up out of the ground in such contexts, as seen on an ash urn.
Other scenes in which Vanth is present involve the meeting and escort of the dead, in the role of psychopompos, who are either walking or being transported on horseback, wagon, or chariot.
