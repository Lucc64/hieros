“Prepositions are among the most idiosyncratic words of any language. Often it is impossible to translate the prepositions of one language exactly into those of another.”  
Given this observation by a wise Egyptologist it is even more astonishing that we can grasp most Egyptian prepositions just by looking at their alphabetic values, at least if we know some German and very basic Spanish and (à) French:  

𓏏 **t**	to  
𓈖 **n**	an (of, belonging to, for), na’ (nach, to), in (time)  
𓂋 **r**	 à (french) at, re (regarding, as for, from, so that), vers, towards, to, until  
𓂜 **nə** no negation (also 𓂜𓈖 non)  
𓏇 milk **ꟿi** ~ wie / like / similak  
𓅓 mñωw  
	 **im**: in, en, ɘn  
	 **mi**: mit=com=with  
	 im prefix **~ing** (im Tanze —> dancing)  
	 **µo**  don’t … negation at start of sentence  
	 **mano** 𓂜 negation (keltic/gaelic)  
𓅓𓅓->𓅔 ‘mn': **among**   (𓅓𓅓𓂝 etc variants giving the ‘o’)  

We postulate either an *ambi*guity or trisonant reading of '𓅓' ✴Amber  
1.) M  
2.) P'R «bird»  

The second reading covers nicely the European prepositional megacluster of  
𓅓𓅨  *ƥ’r: per, par, para, peri, prä, pro, for, für, über, hyper, super, over, pre, prä, vor, fore, 𓅓𓂝 fro’ from  ≠ [𓅖](𓅖)  

Which itself connects with the semitic mega cluster **C-V-R** (meaning cover ...)  

𓁷 [ob/Hr] **cObHerr** 𓁷 Ober, ob, auf, up, upon, on, and, ob->because (german)  
𓁶 *ƥ’rs first 𓁶𓏤𓈖 presence phrs -> face  
𓁶 **top** , atop  
𓁷 **head* -> **at** <-chat ⇔ 𓄂𓏏  

combined:  
𓎛𓈖𓂝    𓎛𓂝𓈖  **ḫon**, con, com, comme (with + and)  
𓄂𓏏 pḫanther/cḫat 𓄂 fronter ~ head   (vs 𓄖 back heck hock)  
𓏅𓈖𓏏 **front* / Kante [xnt]   𓏅 FNT/PNT/5 vs 𓏃 FORe/FRo/FROm/FROnt/fourth/4  
𓏅𓈖𓏏𓏮 **fronty** (adj.) frontier, foremost, pre-eminent in, principal, protruding  
𓐍𓆑𓏏  **face**in'   front, in front of, towards, according to, as well as, corresponding to, facing “katzen” ~ 面 miàn ?  
𓅓  𓏅𓈖𓏏  in front: in the face of, within, out of[xt] (preposition) through, throughout, pervading {M3 Aa1 X1 D54}  
𓆱𓐍𓏏𓂻 **achter**	 (behind)   [xtx] 𓆱𓏏𓆱𓆱𓏤  through  
𓂋𓇉𓄿𓁶  **rear**     behind  
𓏏𓏏𓏝 **toute** / **total**  not to be confused with  
𓏏𓏏 ‘**that’**  or  𓏏𓏏 tit 𓂑𓂑 = 𓃀𓏏𓄹 (bust/breast)
