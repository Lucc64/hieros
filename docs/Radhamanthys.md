Hyksos of typical Indo European stock:  
**Ratha** was a name prefix very prominent in the second millennium BC, as it was the name of drivers the newly invented bit-steered-chariot. (Ritter, rider, rad 𓇳 ray 𒋥 rho ρ 日ri)  

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhadamanthus]]  

Because of the Indian short vowel "Rtha" it entered Greece as 'ortho' 'artchie' 'archae' Ἀρχιμήδης (Arkhimḗdēs).  
It's meaning more or less preserved: right/rule ἀρχός (arkhós) = leader (rex in latin). Order in english.  

Another 'indian' form **Raha** was further simplified into Ra'a or just Ray/Ra/Re: 𓇳  

The '[[Menge]]' root in Radhamanthys constituted some instance of 'Muchness': Big ruler, ruler of many, ruler of mankind or something similar.  

The '[[Menge]]' root was reduced to 'mega' in Greece, 'much' and 'measure' in English and [[medi]]:

So Menge originally was more like Mendge similar to Menschen [mankind].  

In any case Archimedes was probably an echo, a reflection or just a corruption of Radhamanthys.
