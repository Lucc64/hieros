We want to propose something scandalous:  

A marriage between Ham and Sam if you like the Bible.  
A marriage between indo-european and semitic cultures and languages if you prefer it scientific.  

Believe it or not (actually *do* believe it!) : there has been a precedence.  

According to Herodotus (chapter Terpsichore) the most populous known nations on earth were the Hindi and Thraker(including Gaetae). The Hindi lived on a subcontinent called India, the Gaetae somewhere in the North, just where a few centuries later the Hindi and Goth appeared, such a coincidence. Also according to Herodotus, the wisest people on Earth (after the Greeks of course!) were the Gaetae. That is quite a compliment considering that he was well acquainted with the Persian, Sumerian and Egyptian philosophers and mathematicians. Long story short: the North Western branch of the Indo European stock seems to have been greatly marginalized by Roman historians for whatever reasons. Maybe you we to adjust our way of thinking about 'Barbarians' as people who said baratha(brother) instead of frater(latin for brother), but were otherwise not that far off science- and technology wise.  

what does all of this have to do with our marriage? The Proto-Saghae(Think Kasachs, Saxons) and Gaetae,Celts and Aryans(Iranians) and Baratheans(Indians) are sometimes portrayed as if they just colonized their countries but steered clear of the superpowers of their time.  

We propose a different angle to history in asserting that (proto) Indo Europeans had from the beginning been an **central** stratum of the early Civilizations. This might seem trivial and self evident, however once you ask the question how big the influence actually was, you should be open to be surprised by our offered answer: very big.  

Is there any evidence? If the influence is as big as stated than it should be everywhere; and indeed we think it was [Hidden in Plain Sight](Home).  

For some time there has been an agreement that there was a Sprachbund(marriage of tongues) between Akkadian(semitic) and Sumerian.  

We suggest a Sprachbund between old Semitic and European languages, not just through loan words, but even down to the [Grammar](Grammar).  

ð“‚œð“ˆ– N.n egyptian for no, none, null, nein, nada, not, ...  

Here is the first marriage gift (out of [many](Home) ) for our semitic friends:  
We suggest that there is a reading of this word, which is universally compatible:  
ð“‚œð“ˆ– NALLA  

How can we make such an outrageous suggestion for such a beautiful wife?  
Several reasons, one of which we hope will convince you:  
1) ð“ˆ– is known by Egyptian scholars to have a second reading L in foreign words and place names.  
2) ð“ˆ– is the sign for running water. In egypt. With N. Anyone? Ni_e river. Nine? Nein?  
3) ð“‚œð“ˆ– none and null sound too European for a Euro-Semitic Sprachbund  

Only the first argument is valid for any wife with linguistic self-esteem, so we need to proceed to other gifts.  

For our European guests who don't understand the value of the wedding gift:  
It gives us the Semitic negations ð’Œ‘ð’ŒŒ UL and LA ð’†· (Â¬) in one coherent package.  

If you think the whole thing should be called off right now please explain in the [discussion](https://github.com/pannous/hieros/issues/3)
