wine & wool : secondary products revolution 4000BC  

The earliest evidence of a grape-based fermented drink was found in China (c. 7000 BC), true wine (Vitis vinifera) Georgia from 6000 BC,[21][22][23] Iran from 5000 BC,[6] and Sicily from 4000 BC.[8]  

The earliest evidence of a wine production facility is the Areni-1 winery in Armenia and is at least 6100 years old, at the Arpa River (𓇋𓂋𓊪𓏊). (together with oldest leather shoe: Ötzi+200)

The English word "wine" comes from the Proto-Germanic *winam, an early borrowing from the Latin vinum, "wine" or "(grape) vine", itself derived from the Proto-Indo-European stem *win-o- (cf. Armenian: գինի, gini; Ancient Greek: οἶνος oinos; Aeolic Greek: ϝοῖνος woinos; Hittite: wiyana; Lycian: oino).[37][38][39] The earliest attested terms referring to wine are the Mycenaean Greek 𐀕𐀶𐀺𐄀𐀚𐀺 me-tu-wo ne-wo (*μέθυϝος νέϝῳ),[40][41] meaning "in (the month)" or "(festival) of the new wine", and 𐀺𐀜𐀷𐀴𐀯 wo-no-wa-ti-si,[42] meaning "wine garden", written in Linear B inscriptions.[43][44][45][46] Linear B also includes, inter alia, an ideogram for wine, i.e. 𐂖.
