[[Jakobiner]]  

The Semitic custom of treating all names with 'Ja' as semitic seems like a cheap trick.  
It's like saying that He=God therefore Heracles must mean 'God' + r-c-l (whatever word you find: God-recalls ...). This custom is very unsatisfying (and in most cases likely wrong). Names should **not** be used to identify the ethnics of Kings.

Erde ⇔ Erd@Semitic  
Germanic and Semitic words are surprisingly similar. Maybe a loanword?  

Problem being, as you trace the origins of the words back through their known etymologies, they become more different instead of similar.
