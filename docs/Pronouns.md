Pronouns  

ürh, tu, she, es, unous, thine, them, sin, sun, su, who, whon, one, all, that  

Egyptian pronouns seem to hint at a linguistic Bridge between Semitic/Berber- languages and European languages:  

|	Person	| Sign	| Suffix 	| Dependent 	| Cognates  
|----------------|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------  
1st s. 		|𓇋	|-ı͗ 	|wı͗ 		|I,je,we,wo,ich  
2nd s.m. 	|𓎡	|-c’ 	|t’ 		|you,tu,Du  
2nd s.f. 	|𓏏	|-t 	|tən 		|te,ton,Dein  
3rd s.m. 	|𓆑	|-φ/sn 	|pshn		|phe,phis,son,sein,su  
3rd s.f. 	|𓋴	|-s 	|si 		|she, sie, es  
1st p. 		|𓈖𓏪	|-nu 	|n 		|nous,uns,on  
2nd p. 		|𓏏𓈖𓏪	|-tn 	|tn 		|ton,thine  
3rd p. 		|𓋴𓈖𓏪	|-sn 	|sn 		|semn~them  

Independent pronouns are prefixed by [𓈖](𓈖)[𓏏](𓏏) which is similar to latin **ante-** as directional **An**rede (address), compare with ancient greek ἦστ (n?)este forms. The first person form is irregular with variants of 𓅱𓈖𓎡 moi,mon,mine,we,uck…  

The hypothesized ancient forms of the ‘letters’  𓆑 𓎡 𓇋 𓅱 (see [Alphabet](Alphabet) and [Axioms](Axioms)) with slight shifts and dangling connotations play well into the above table:  
[𓆑](𓆑) φ pthn~s*n:  φίδιn python snake [usually simple transcribed as ‘f’]  
[𓎡](𓎡) *tcu: Kelle/cup/tasse [alt] vs jug, jar  
[𓇋](𓇋) *fe feather/vieh -> ve / we  
[𓅱](𓅱) µω:= u, uu, w, ‘un, ‘en, mwn  

[Plural](Plural) 𓏪 ‘thir3’ 𓈖𓏪 n.thir->unser   ω+𓋴+𓂋  
[Dual](dual)  

The following are the personal pronouns of Mehri, an extant language spoken in Yemen and Oman.  

person|english|Mehri|IE  
------|-------|-----|--  
1st sg. 		|"I" 	|hōh 	-ī  
2nd sg. masc. 	|"you" 	 	|-(a)k  
3rd sg. masc. 	|"he" 	 	|-(a)h  
3rd sg. fem. 	|"she" 	 	|-(a)s  
1st pl.		 |"we" 	|nḥah 	-(a)n	|nous  
2nd pl. fem. 	|"you" 	|tān 	-kan	|thine  
3rd pl. fem. 	|"they" 	|sān 	-san	|them  

This paradigma has an astonishing alignment with the Egyptian pronouns, and with english / ‘European’ pronouns for that matter! It also reflects the t/c/k 𓏏𓍿𓎡 shift for 'thy'.  
Mehri sounded foreign ‘barbaric’ to al-Hamdani, a well versed Arabic geographer -945 A.D, suggesting that it was not Northwest-Semitic.  

The basic pronouns align well with PIE (especially Spanish, English and German),  
However the Egyptian forms align even better with Berber dialects, warranting the long held association with Afroasiatic (Semitic-Hamitic) languages:  
Berber  nat/nath~nas: natche (𓈖𓏏-je) natta (𓈖𓏏-ta) nasse (𓈖𓏏-she)  

Again, this may not forbid links to European languages, rather hint to basal Egyptian intermediate or root forms.  

Oddity: compare Berber natta - هو  with 𓆑 φ pthn~s*n:  φίδιn python snake
