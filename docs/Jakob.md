Egyptian hieroglyps preserve a fantastic case of biblical historicity and of astonishing continuity in names over the Millenia:  

One of the [[Hyksos]] Kings is called.  
𓇋 𓄿 𓎡 𓃀 I.A.K.B which in all likeliness is a rendering of our Jacob!  

This is most remarkable and relevant. We also find the name of his followers:  
𓇋 𓄿 𓎡 𓃀 𓇋 𓇋 𓁸 𓏥||mourners|Jakobians  

The only thing to add is the possibility that the [[Semitic]] [[etymology]] of this name is flawed, and that the original reading might have been closer to  

[[𓇋]] 𓄿 𓎡 𓃀 Vi.ar K.b* which could naturally mean anything.  

Fortunately we have a prominent vocabulary entry for the first part:  
𓇋 𓄿 𓅱 𓀀 𓏪 Old Man   `i.air.[[o]] > Hiero < [[gero]]  
or 𓇋𓄿 vyear > vielle  

So 'Jacob' might have been HieroCoptus, or somthing very different.  

A connection to Kadmos of Greek mythology is not supported by anything other than one letter '𓎡', and the fact that the last king of the [[Hyksos]], Khamudi, matches some of the legends and archaeological findings about Kadmos quite nicely.

The Semitic custom of treating all names with 'Ja' as semitic seems like a cheap trick.  
It's like saying that He=God therefore Heracles must mean 'God' + r-c-l (whatever word you find: God-recalls ...). This custom is very unsatisfying (and in most cases likely wrong). Names should **not** be used to identify the ethnics of Kings.
