𓂝 Letter A & **O** Ar Arm ⋆Carpa! Dharma [𓂧](𓂧) *Hand  

Original form hard to reconstruct.  
it probably had a very hard strong A which either explicitly or implicitly carried a preceding H-cluster and a succeeding m/n. Prefixed 'c','ch' or 'd' might come from the [dual](Dual)ity. As so often the 'r' might have been injected later by over-accentuating or have been lost in many cases.
