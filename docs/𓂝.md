Original form hard to reconstruct.  
it probably had a very hard strong A which either explicitly or implicitly carried a preceding H-cluster and a succeeding m/n. The 'd' might come from the duality. As so often the 'r' might have been injected later by over-accentuating or have been lost in many cases.
