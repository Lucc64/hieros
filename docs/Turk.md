The Turk language family is an oddity which can still be linked to the superfamily  

Science even puts it at the [root of PIE](https://www.nature.com/news/a-turkish-origin-for-indo-european-languages-1.11270)

 see [Pronouns](Pronouns)  

beni/eyim 	bin ich / I am !  
seni 	er sein (shen@kartvelian)  
onu/-sin 	on (man@french)  [𓆑](𓆑)  
bizi 	wir sind? note familiar -zi plural  
sizi 	sie sind! note familiar -zi plural  
onları  on/leur  

grammatical forms are very mixed but can still be recognised  

Conditional  -se 	"if only" ⇔ si, whether [𓇋](𓇋)𓂋 währe fir for…  
Inferential  -miş "seems" [𓏇](𓏇)  
Past 	-di "walk**ed**"  
Negative 	-me "mano" [𓅓](𓅓)[𓂜](𓂜)[𓅱](𓅱)  
Positive 	-ier 𓂻  𓍘𓏲𓀁 sein [𓃹](𓃹)𓈖 being [𓃀](𓃀)  
Necessitative 	-meli  must-I ⇔ 马 mwahri [𓐙](𓐙) «true?» vs 'really' خیلی  

Interrogative particle mi is linked to Negative. German: ne? asiatic ma? 马mǎ?  

This is not meant to be evidence of a Nostratic anchestoral language, just for linguistic interbreeding between the [Getae](Getae) (Goth) [Saxa](Saxa) and Turks, who undisputedly lived on the same territories for millennia.  

However the [eurasian](Eurasian) pool of common syllables and patterns is astonishingly coherent.
