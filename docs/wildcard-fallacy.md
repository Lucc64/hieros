wildcard fallacy  

one sign generating all words 'PTRM=VCLN'  

There are universal sound changes and seemingly odd changes specific to languages.  

It is often reasonable to assume a very blurred out distribution for a particular Reading:  

Look at the cluster Pod-Pfote-bein-boot-foot-ferse ... covering everything from p to f  

after 3000 years in the Egyptian language we can suspect many such broad traces *combined* :  

D-DT-T  
T-TH-S-C  
D-DS-S (demi - semi)  
C-CH-CK-K  
D-DZ-DJ-DCH-CH  

combining two of these can lead to a Spektrum leading from K to D, which is not a usual sound change.  

asides from the ordinary sound changes and R-L in Egypt we find an affinity of  
NV  
NM  
MB  
MW  mit/with mo/wood  


Traces between (semi)vowels don't help  
W-U-OO-O-OA-A-AR W-R etc  

quickly all letters of the alphabet can be reached with just three or four consonants: M T P R  

Thus giving a sign the infamous sequence ¬µPTR can lead to almost all words in the dictionary if we allowed substrings. ¬µPTR=map.tr ¬µPTR‚ãçpthr‚ãçprth‚ãçprice ‚Ä¶  pick any word.  

Thus one needs to be very careful avoiding this sequence or extending known words with 'just an extra m or r'.  

That's a dilemma because some words actually might have had such a sequence / cluster  
P-T-R father ...  
ìÜë PTHN? probably PTH ‚áî 'PSI' though  
CEPHAL (head) ‚áî KOPPER ‚áî CAPUT.ma  

fortunately these appear in quite specific contexts.  

In those cases one must be careful abusing the blurriness for words which probably have such sequence.
