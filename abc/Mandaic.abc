Mandaic << Aramaic (lingua franca of the 
Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC), and then the succeeding 
Neo-Babylonian Empire (605–539 BC), 
Achaemenid Empire (539–323 BC), 
Parthian Empire (247 BC–224 AD), and the 
Sasanian Empire (224–651)) «Ērānshahr»

Aramaic and Hebrew are quite close, but they do have many small differences. A major difference is the way in which they use the word "the." In Hebrew, "the" is a prefix ה (ha-) and in Aramaic "the" is a suffix א (-a).
There are numerous vowel differences as well, especially in the conjugation of verbs.
Certain patterns of letter substitution also appear. For example, Hebrew words that contain a ש (sh) are sometimes spelled with a ת (t) in Aramaic. Words that contain a ז (z) in Hebrew are sometimes spelled with a ד (d) in Aramaic.

 	Ligatures[edit]
The 23rd letter of the alphabet is the digraph adu (da + ya), the relative particle[1][5] (cf. Arabic tāʾ marbūṭa, Coptic letter "ti", and English ampersand).
In addition to normal joining behavior, some Mandaic letters can combine to form various ligatures:[3][7]
ࡊࡃ /kd/, ࡗ /kḏ/, ࡊࡉ /ki/, ࡊࡋ /kl/, ࡊࡓ /kr/, ࡊࡕ /kt/, and ࡊࡅ /ku/
ࡍࡃ /nd/, ࡍࡉ /ni/, ࡍࡌ /nm/, ࡍࡒ /nq/, ࡍࡕ /nt/, and ࡍࡅ /nu/
ࡐࡋ /pl/, ࡐࡓ /pr/, and ࡐࡅ /pu/
ࡑࡋ /ṣl/, ࡑࡓ /ṣr/, and ࡑࡅ /ṣu/
ࡅࡕ /ut/

Postclassical and modern Mandaic use many Persian words. Various Mandaic letters can be re-purposed by placing two horizontally-aligned dots underneath (U+0859 ◌࡙ MANDAIC AFFRICATION MARK). This idea is comparable to the four novel letters in the Persian alphabet, allowing the alphabet to be used to represent foreign sounds (whether affrication, lenition, or another sound):[7]
ࡂ /g/ becomes ࡂ࡙ /γ/
ࡃ /d/ becomes ࡃ࡙ /δ/
ࡄ /h/ becomes ࡄ࡙ /ḥ/
ࡈ /ṭ/ becomes ࡈ࡙ /ẓ/
ࡊ /k/ becomes ࡊ࡙ /χ/
ࡐ /p/ becomes ࡐ࡙ /f/
ࡑ /ṣ/ becomes ࡑ࡙ /ž/
ࡔ /š/ becomes ࡔ࡙ /č/, /ǰ/
ࡕ /t/ becomes ࡕ࡙ /θ/

[edit]
Mandaic ayin (ࡘ) is borrowed from Arabic ayin (ع)[1]. Unlike in Arabic, Mandaic ayin does not join with other letters.[7]
