Quipu (also spelled khipu) or talking knots,[1] were recording devices fashioned from strings historically used by a number of cultures, particularly in the region of Andean South America.[2]

similar systems were also used by the ancient Chinese and native Hawaiians

The cords stored numeric and other values encoded as knots, often in a base ten positional system. A quipu could have only a few or up to 2,000 cords.

Objects that can be identified unambiguously as quipus first appear in the archaeological record in the first millennium AD.
