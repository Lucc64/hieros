            <p>
	Thousands of years ago in what is now northern Israel, waves of 
migrating people from the north and east — present-day Iran and Turkey —
 arrived in the region. And this influx of newcomers had a profound 
effect, transforming the emerging culture.</p>
<p>
	What's more, these immigrants not only brought new cultural practices; 
they also introduced new genes — such as the mutation that produces blue
 eyes — that were previously unknown in that geographic area, according 
to a new study.</p>
<p>
	Archaeologists recently discovered this historic population shift by 
analyzing DNA from skeletons preserved in an Israeli cave. The site, in 
the north of the tiny country, contains dozens of burials and more than 
600 bodies dating to approximately 6,500 years ago, the scientists 
reported. [<a href="https://www.livescience.com/40046-holy-land-archaeological-finds.html">The Holy Land: 7 Amazing Archaeological Finds</a>]</p>
<p>
	DNA analysis showed that skeletons preserved in the cave were 
genetically distinct from people who historically lived in that region. 
And some of the genetic differences matched those of people who lived in
 neighboring Anatolia and the Zagros Mountains, which are now part of 
Turkey and Iran, the study found.</p>
<p>
	Ancient Israel (then called Galilee) belonged to a region known as the 
southern Levant, part of a larger area, the Levant, which encompasses 
today's eastern Mediterranean countries. The southern Levant experienced
 a significant cultural shift during the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/57168-earliest-polluted-river-found-jordan.html">Late Chalcolithic period</a>,
 around 4500 B.C.E. to 3800 B.C.E, with denser settlements, more rituals
 performed in public and a growing use of ossuaries in funerary 
preparations, the researchers reported.</p>
<p>
	Though some experts had previously proposed that cultural 
transformation was driven by people who were native to the southern 
Levant, the authors of the new study suspected that waves of human 
migration explained the changes. To find answers, the scientists turned 
to a burial site in Israel's Peqi’in Cave, in what would have been <a href="https://www.livescience.com/55774-ancient-israel.html">Upper Galilee</a> 6,500 years ago.</p>
<h2 class="nolinks">
	Unraveling an ancestry puzzle</h2>
<p>
	Peqi'in is a natural cave, measuring around 56 feet (17 meters) long 
and about 16 to 26 feet (5 to 8 m) wide. Inside the cave are decorated 
jars and burial offerings — along with hundreds of skeletons — 
suggesting that the location served as a type of mortuary for 
Chalcolithic people who lived nearby.</p>
<p>
	However, not all of the cave's contents appeared to have local origins,
 study co-author Dina Shalem, an archaeologist with the Institute for 
Galilean Archaeology at Kinneret College in Israel, said <a href="https://www.aftau.org/news-page-archaeology?&amp;storyid4677=2407&amp;ncs4677=3">in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>
	"Some of the findings in the cave are typical to the region, but others
 suggest cultural exchange with remote regions," Shalem said. The <a href="https://www.livescience.com/56986-ancient-thinker-sculpture-uncovered-in-israel.html">artistic styles</a>
 of these artifacts bear closer resemblance to styles common to 
more-northern regions of the Near East, lead study author Eadaoin 
Harney, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Organismic and 
Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, told Live Science in an 
email.</p>
<p>
	The scientists sampled DNA from <a href="https://www.livescience.com/3247-ancient-walls-covered-powdered-animal-bones.html">bone powder</a>
 from 48 skeletal remains and were able to reconstruct genomes for 22 
individuals found in the cave. That makes this one of the largest 
genetic studies of ancient DNA in the Near East, the researchers 
reported.</p>
<h2 class="nolinks">
	Blue eyes and fair skin</h2>
<p>
	The scientists found that these individuals shared genetic features 
with people from the north, and those similar genes were absent in 
farmers who lived in the southern Levant earlier. For example, the 
allele (one of two or more alternative forms of a gene) that is 
responsible <a href="https://www.livescience.com/9578-common-ancestor-blue-eyes.html">for blue eyes</a>
 was associated with 49 percent of the sampled remains, suggesting that 
blue eyes had become common in people living in Upper Galilee. Another 
allele hinted that fair skin may have been widespread in the local 
population as well, the study authors wrote.</p>
<p>
	"Both eye and skin color are traits that are controlled by complex 
interactions between multiple alleles, many — but not all — of which 
have been identified," Harney explained.</p>
<p>
	"The two alleles that we highlight in our study are known to be 
strongly associated with light eye and skin color, respectively, and are
 often used to make predictions about the appearance of various human 
populations in ancient DNA studies," she said.</p>
<p>
	However, it is important to note that multiple other alleles can influence the color of eyes <a href="https://www.livescience.com/41040-skin-color-genes-identified-india.html">and skin</a> in individuals, Harney added, so "scientists cannot perfectly predict pigmentation in an individual." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The scientists also discovered that genetic diversity increased within 
groups over time, while genetic differences between groups decreased; 
this is a pattern that typically emerges in populations after a period 
of <a href="https://www.livescience.com/62256-ancient-human-finger-in-arabia.html">human migration</a>, according to the researchers.</p>
<h2 class="nolinks">
	A dynamic past</h2>
<p>
	By presenting DNA from the distant past, these findings offer exciting new insights into the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/59970-etruscans-were-expert-beekeepers.html">dynamic ancient world</a>
 and the diverse human populations that inhabited it, said Daniel 
Master, a professor of archaeology at Wheaton College in Illinois.</p>
<p>
	"One of the key questions of the Chalcolithic has always been to what 
extent the groups in Galilee were connected to the groups in the 
Be'ersheva Valley or the Jordan Valley or the Golan Heights," Master, 
who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.</p>
<p>
	"The publication of the artifacts from Peqi'in has shown many cultural 
links between these regions, but it will be interesting to see, in the 
future, whether those links are genetic as well," Master said.</p>
<p>
	The researchers' results also resolve a long-standing debate about the 
pivotal factor that changed the trajectory of the Chalcolithic peoples' 
unique culture, Shalem said in the statement.</p>
<p>
	"We now know that the answer is migration," she said.</p>
<p>
	The findings were published online Aug. 20 in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05649-9">Nature Communications</a>.</p>

 may automatically collect certain information about the computer or 
devices (including mobile devices or tablets) you use to access the 
Services. As described further below, we may collect and analyze 
information such as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information, unique 
device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, and other information about
 your computer or device(s), browser types, browser language, operating 
system, mobile device carrier information, the state or country from 
which you accessed the Services; and (b) information related to the ways
 in which you interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit 
web pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, 
landing pages, pages and content (such as advertisements) viewed and the
 order of those pages, statistical information about the use of the 
Services (such as barcodes scanned through certain of our mobile apps), 
the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used
 the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error logs,

use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies 
and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.</p><p>We 
also collect and analyze information from your browser or device, such 
as, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, resolution and other 
data, for purposes of creating a unique profile or “fingerprint” of your
 browser or device. We may use this profile or fingerprint to understand
 and analyze how you interact with the Services, to customize content or
 advertising to you through the Services, to monitor against fraud or 
misuse of the Services, or in other ways consistent with this Privacy 
Policy.</p><h4>2.&nbsp;Location Information</h4><p>We and our service 
providers may automatically collect location information, including 
general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) from your computer or 
mobile device. If you access the Services through a mobile device, we 
may also ask you to share your specific geo-location information with 
us. The Services use this location information to provide customized 
location-based services, content, promotional offers and other 
information that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;For example, if you use
 our ShopSavvy mobile application, with your permission, we collect 
geolocation information from your device that will allow us to present 
location-based alerts such as nearby retailers or coupons, or organize 
products searched or scans based on the closest applicable 
retailer.&nbsp;We may also use location information to improve the 
functionality of the Services and our other products services.&nbsp;We 
and our service providers may also collect other information based on 
your location and your device’s proximity to “beacons” and other similar
 indoor proximity systems, including, for example, the strength of the 
signal between the “beacon” and your device and the duration that your 
device is near the “beacon.”&nbsp;If you do not wish to have this 
location information collected and used by us and our service providers,
 you may disable the location features on your device.&nbsp;Please note 
that if you disable such features, you will not be able to access or 
receive some or all of the services, content, features and/or products 
made available via the Services.&nbsp;Also see the “Tailored 
Advertising” section below for more choices regarding the delivery of 
interest-based content and advertising.</p><h4>3.&nbsp;Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies</h4><p>We
 and our service providers may also collect data about your use of the 
Services through the use of Internet server logs, cookies and/or 
tracking pixels. A web server log is a file where website activity is 
stored to distinguish you from other users of our website. A cookie is a
 small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a 
website, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store 
your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the 
Services you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by 
delivering content specific to your interests; (v) perform searches and 
analytics; and (vi) assist with security administrative functions. Some 
cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with 
Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files. 
Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are
 tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, 
online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage 
information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the 
Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we 
adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information
 through other methods. We also gather information and identify users 
through the fingerprinting methods described in Section 2(a) above.</p><p>We and our service providers use the following cookies:</p><ul><li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies.</strong>
 These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website. 
They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure 
areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing 
services.</li><li><strong>Analytical/performance cookies.</strong> They 
allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how 
visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us 
to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that 
users are finding what they are looking for easily.</li><li><strong>Functionality cookies.</strong>
 These are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This 
enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and 
remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or 
region).</li><li><strong>Targeting cookies.</strong> These cookies 
record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the 
links you have followed. We will use this information to make our 
website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your 
interests. We may also share this information with third parties for 
this purpose.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Except for essential cookies, all cookies will expire after 13 months.</p><p>Your
 usage of the website without changing your browser cookies settings 
will indicate your consent understanding of our use of cookies in 
accordance with this section of this Policy. You can change your cookie 
settings at any time. Please note that you can change your settings to 
notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies 
altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more

 you access the Services through a third-party connection or log-in 
(e.g., through a social network), you may allow us to have access to and
 store certain information in your social network profile.&nbsp;This may
 include your first name, last name, gender, general location, a link to
 your profile, your time zone, birthday, profile picture, your “likes” 
and your list of friends.&nbsp;If you do not wish to have this 
information shared, do not use a social networking connection to access 
the Services. For a description on how social networking sites handle 
your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of 
use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings. If you signed
 up using a social media log-in by mistake, you may be able to delete 
your account through your account settings at any time, or you can

Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter or other social media sites, we 
may collect some information from you including your name, e-mail 
address, and any comments or content you post relevant to us. We may

advertisements. Please see the “Tailored Online and Mobile Advertising” 
section below for more information.</p><p>We may also obtain information
 about you if you use any other websites that we operate or may operate

 may disclose and/or share your information between members of the Purch
 corporate group, and to or with any non-affiliated third parties under 
the following circumstances:</p><ul><li><strong>Consent.</strong>&nbsp;We may disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so.</li><li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;We
 may provide access to or share your information with select third 
parties who perform services on our behalf and for any other legitimate 
business purpose. These third parties provide a variety of services to 
us, including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising,
 market research, customer support, fulfillment, data storage, analysis 
and processing, and legal services.</li><li><strong>Business Partners.</strong>&nbsp;We
 may provide your information to individuals and companies with whom we 
have business relationships to provide you with special coupons, 
discounts, or promotions, or to offer products and services to you for 
purchase. We encourage these partners to adopt and post privacy 
policies. However, the use of your Information by such parties is 
governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to 
our control.</li><li><strong>Protection of Purch and Others.</strong> By
 using the Services, you acknowledge, consent and agree that we may 
access, preserve and disclose your information, including, but not 
limited to, any user content, if required to do so by law or in a good 
faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably 
necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.purch.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of Service</a>,
 this Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of

 similar purposes.</li><li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> As we 
continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with 
other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of 
such transactions, e.g., due diligence) user information may be among 
the transferred assets. If a portion or all of Purch’s assets are sold 
or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your 
email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.</li><li><strong>Public Forums.</strong>&nbsp;Our
 Services offer publicly accessible blogs and community forums. You 
should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be 
read, collected, and used by others who access them. Please also 
remember that if you choose to provide information on public features of
 the Services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose 
it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your
 knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore 
urge you to think carefully about what you choose to disclose publicly 
and make sure it’s information you want to share with the public.</li></ul><h2>4. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA</h2><p>The
 laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the 
legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the 
extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing your personal 
data are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You.</strong>
 Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual 
obligations to our customers, or to take steps at customers’ request in 
anticipation of entering into a contract with them.</li><li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong>
 In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers 
our legitimate interests in commercial activities such as the following 
in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights 
and freedoms of the affected individuals:</li><li>Customer service</li><li>Marketing</li><li>Protecting our customers, personnel and property</li><li>Analyzing and improving our business</li><li>Managing legal issues</li></ul><p>We may also process personal data for the same legitimate interests of our customers and business partners.</p><ul><li><strong>Legal Compliance.</strong> We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li><li><strong>Consent.</strong>
 Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data
 on the basis of consent. Where we handle your personal data on the 
basis of consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.</li></ul><h2>5. PERSONALIZED CONTENT AND ADVERTISING</h2><h3>A. Online and Email Analytics</h3><p>We
 may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as 
those of Google Analytics.&nbsp;These service providers use the sort of 
technology previously described in the “Cookies and other electronic 
technologies” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, 
including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and 
provide certain features to you. For example, the Google Trusted Store 
badge displayed on some of the Services is served to you through the use
 of cookies. The information (including your IP address) collected by 
the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these 
service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the 
Services.&nbsp;We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related
 to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent 
Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may 
install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here.</a></p><p>If
 you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs
 to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links
 or banners our email contains.&nbsp;This data allows us to gauge the 
effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p><h3>B. Tailored Online and Mobile Advertising</h3><p>We
 may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the
 Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that 
allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the 
Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you
 use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the
 page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and 
gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and 
other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your 
current activity or your activity over time and across other websites 
and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p><p>In connection with the foregoing, we work with DigiTrust to set a first-party cookie in your browser to enable us and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.digitru.st/participating-companies/">DigiTrust&nbsp;Partners</a>to
 collect web viewing data that includes visits to the Services and 
non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer 
whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising 
relevant to those inferences. Also, third parties whose products or 
services are accessible or advertised via the Services may place cookies
 or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other
 device to collect information about your use of the Services in order 
to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our 
websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other 
uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad 
services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services. 
We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such
 as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to 
you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to 
access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your 
computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. 
We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your 
email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you 
share publicly when using the services (e.g., user-generated content) 
for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access 
to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking 
technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other
 device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad
 technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third 
parties. Those parties that use these technologies, including DigiTrust,
 may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You 
may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.
 If you are interested in more information about tailored browser 
advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on 
your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a> , the <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/%20">opt-out page of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</a>, or <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">TrustArc’s Preference Manager</a>
 to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that 
participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in 
advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our 
advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through 
the Services.</p><p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Ads Settings page</a>.
 Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated 
into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you 
opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be 
tailored.</p><p>When using a mobile application you may also receive 
tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for 
Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft 
devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of 
tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support 
materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating 
systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements. For any other 
devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for 
the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. We do
 not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control 
receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should 
contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of 
tailored in-application advertisements. We also may use third-party 
service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or 
for mobile application analytics.&nbsp;You can opt-out from third-party 
interest-based advertising on some Android devices and Google apps by 
visiting Google Settings, Ads and then click on ‘Disable ads based on 
interests.’&nbsp;You can also opt out of some interest-based advertising
 on your mobile device by downloading the TrustArc Privacy App available
 at:&nbsp;https://www.trustarc.com/consumer-resources/privacy-app/.</p><p>Please
 note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the 
Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. n 
that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also,
 we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any 
particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out 
programs.&nbsp; We are not responsible for any choices you make using 
these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these 
mechanisms.</p><h3>C. Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals</h3><p>Do 
Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain 
web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform online services that they
 do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected 
over time and across websites or services. We are committed to providing
 you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the 
Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide links to 
the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>
 opt-out pages, as well as choices provided by Google Ads, Google 
Analytics, and TrustArc. However, we do not recognize or respond to 
browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently 
still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to 
comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn 
more about Do Not Track, you can do so <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/">here</a></p><h2>6. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h2><p>You

at any time by: (a) going to the link provided at the bottom of any 
email you receive and opting out of receiving future information; or (b)

them, to access personal data we hold about them, and to obtain its 
correction, update, amendment, or deletion in appropriate circumstances.
 You may also have rights to object to our handling of your personal 
data, restrict our processing of your personal data, and to withdraw any
 consent you have provided. To exercise these rights, please contact us

information. This proof of identity will typically take the form of your
 e-mail address and any password submitted upon registration. While we 
strongly encourage you to first raise any questions or concerns about 
your personal data with us, you also have a right to contact the 
relevant supervisory authority.</p><p>Many of the rights described here 
are subject to significant limitations and exceptions under applicable 
law (e.g., objections to the processing of personal data, and 
withdrawals of consent, typically will not have retroactive effect).</p><h2>7. SECURITY</h2><p>We
 have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security 
measures to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of your 
information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the 
information that we collect and store. All information you provide to us

with anyone.</p><p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via 
the internet is not completely secure, and although we will do our best 
to protect your information, we cannot and do not guarantee that the 
measures we take will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use,
 or disclose your information since despite our efforts, as no Internet 
and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure and any 
transmission is at your own risk.</p><p>It is important for you to 
protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your 
computer so we advise that you sign off when you have finished using a

Grounds for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a) 
breaches or violations of these Terms or other agreements, (b) requests 
by law enforcement or government agencies, (c) discontinuance or 
material modification of the Services (or any part thereof), (d) 
unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (e) extended 
periods of inactivity (f) activities related to protecting the rights, 
property or safety of Purch, its agents and affiliates, its users and 
the public; or (g) if you provide any information, including 
registration information, that is false, inaccurate, out-of-date, or 
incomplete. If we terminate for no reason your right to access the 
Services, we will fulfill our obligations to you related to any order 
outstanding at the time of termination. If you terminate your account, 
you will remain liable under these Terms for any purchase made prior to 
termination. If we terminate your right to access the Services, these 
Terms will terminate and all rights you have to access the Services will
 immediately terminate; however, certain provisions of these Terms will 
still apply post termination, including without limitation, the 
Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions. Termination of
 your account may also include, at Purch’s sole discretion, the deletion
 of your account and/or User Content.</p><p><strong>14. MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></p><p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p><p>14.1
 Application. You and Purch agree that these Terms affect interstate 
commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation
 and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section 14 is 
intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes 
between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or 
relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in 
contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal 
theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement 
(including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and 
claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only 
disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of 
certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</p><p>14.2
 Initial Dispute Resolution. Most disputes can be resolved without 
resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that 
before taking any formal action, you will contact us at <a href="mailto:storesupport@purch.com">storesupport@purch.com</a>,
 and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your 
contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to
 an account). Except for intellectual property and small claims court 
claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any 
dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation 
with Purch, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either 
party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p><p>14.3 Binding 
Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a
 period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is 
initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then 
either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to 
resolve claims, (except as provided in section 14.7 below) subject to 
the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or 
relating to these Terms (including the Terms’ formation, performance, 
and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use 
of Purch shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by
 JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure 
Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive 
Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect
 at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or 
procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p><p>14.4 
Arbitrator’s Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or 
local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all 
disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, 
applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but
 not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or
 voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of
 waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to 
grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in 
equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on 
the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent 
jurisdiction.</p><p>14.5 Filing a Demand. To start an arbitration, you 
must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a
 description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover 
(you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); 
(b) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the 
appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San
 Francisco California 94111; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for 
Arbitration to us at Purch, Attn: Legal Department, 11 West 
42nd&nbsp;Street, 15th&nbsp;Floor, New York, NY 10036.</p><p>To the 
extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a 
lawsuit, Purch will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the
 arbitration to be non-frivolous, Purch will pay the fees invoiced by 
JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are
 responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules 
and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p><p>The parties understand 
that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the 
right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand 
that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs
 of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in 
arbitration than in court. Arbitration may take place in the county 
where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to 
another location or telephonic arbitration.</p><p>14.6 Class Action 
Waiver. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be 
conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not 
as a class action or other representative action, and the parties 
expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a 
class basis. YOU AND PURCH AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE 
OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
 CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If 
any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set 
forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that 
an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration 
provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their 
entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate
 disputes.</p><p>14.7 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and
 Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to 
resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring 
enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or 
relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property 
in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to 
protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights”
 means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets,
 but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief
 in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that
 court’s jurisdiction.</p><p>14.8 30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the 
right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action 
waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your 
decision to opt out to at <a href="mailto:storesupport@purch.com">storesupport@purch.com</a>
 with the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” 
The notice must be sent within thirty days of your first use of the 
Services. Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in 
accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these 
arbitration provisions, Purch also will not be bound by them.</p><p>14.9
 Changes to This Section: Purch will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of
 any changes to this section by posting on the Services. Amendments will
 become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Services
 or sent to you by email. Changes to this section will otherwise apply 
prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a
 court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to This 
Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be 
severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action
 Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory 
Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began
 using the Services.</p><p>14.10 Survival. This Mandatory Arbitration 
and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your 
use of Purch Perks.</p><p><strong>15. Controlling Law and Severability</strong></p><p>These
 Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of 
New York, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. If any part 
of these Terms is considered invalid, it shall be enforced as 
effectively as possible while all other provisions remain in full 
effect.</p><p><strong>16. GENERAL TERMS</strong></p><p>16.1 Force 
Majeure. Under no circumstances shall Purch or its licensor or supplier 
be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting 
directly or indirectly from an event beyond its reasonable control.</p><p>16.2
 No Waiver; Severability. No waiver of any term of these Terms will be 
binding unless in writing, no waiver of any term of these Terms will be 
deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, 
and the failure of Purch to exercise or enforce any right or remedy in 
these Terms does not waive that right or remedy. If an arbitrator or a 
court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be
 invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give 
effect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the parties’ 
intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of 
these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p><p>16.3 Third-Party
 Beneficiaries. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided 
in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these 
Terms.</p><p>16.4 Miscellaneous. These Terms (and all terms and 
conditions incorporated herein) constitute the entire agreement between 
you and Purch and govern your use of the Services, Services and products
 provided by Purch, and supersede any prior agreements between you and 
Purch on the subject matter. These Terms, and any rights or licenses 
granted hereunder, may not be assigned or delegated by you. These Terms,
 and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may be assigned or 
delegated by Purch without restriction. These Terms bind and inure to 
the benefit of each party and the party’s successors and permitted 
assigns. These Terms may not be modified by an oral statement by a 
representative of Purch. No agency, partnership, joint venture or 
employee-employer relationship is intended or created by these Terms. 
You agree that any agreements made by and between you and us in 
electronic form are as legally binding as if made in physical written 
form. These Terms will not be construed against the drafter. 
“Include(s)” or “including” means, respectively, “include(s) without 
limitation” or “including without limitation”, unless expressly stated 
otherwise. If you are using the Services for or on behalf of the U.S. 
government, your license rights do not exceed those granted to 
non-government consumers. The section titles in these Terms are for 
convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p><p>16.5 
Notices. We may deliver notice to you by e-mail, posting a notice on the
 Services or any other method we choose and such notice will be 
effective on dispatch. If you give notice to us, it will be effective 
when received and you must use the following physical or email address: 
(1) Purch, 11 West 42nd&nbsp;Street, 15th&nbsp;Floor, New York, NY 
10036; or (2) <a href="mailto:storesupport@purch.com">storesupport@purch.com</a>.</p><p><strong>17.
