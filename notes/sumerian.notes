The following lexicon contains 1,255 Sumerian logogram words and 2,511 Sumerian compound words. A logogram is a reading of a cuneiform sign which represents a word in the spoken language. Sumerian scribes invented the practice of writing in cuneiform on clay tablets sometime around 3400 B.C. in the Uruk/Warka region of southern Iraq. The language that they spoke, Sumerian, is known to us through a large body of texts and through bilingual cuneiform dictionaries of Sumerian and Akkadian, the language of their Semitic successors, to which Sumerian is not related. These bilingual dictionaries date from the Old Babylonian period (1800-1600 B.C.), by which time Sumerian had ceased to be spoken, except by the scribes. The earliest and most important words in Sumerian had their own cuneiform signs, whose origins were pictographic, making an initial repertoire of about a thousand signs or logograms. Beyond these words, two-thirds of this lexicon now consists of words that are transparent compounds of separate logogram words. I have greatly expanded the section containing compounds in this version, but I know that many more compound words could be added.

BCE-System
Many cuneiform signs can be pronounced in more than one way and often two or more signs share the same pronunciation, in which case it is necessary to indicate in the transliteration which cuneiform sign is meant; Assyriologists have developed a system whereby the second homophone is marked by an acute accent ( ́), the third homophone by a grave accent (`), and the remainder by subscript numerals. [If the small font size prevents you from seeing whether the accent is acute or grave, click on View and Zoom and scroll up to 125%.] The homophone numeration here follows the 'BCE-System' developed by Borger, Civil, and Ellermeier. The 'accents' and subscript numerals do not affect the pronunciation. The numeration system is a convention to inform Assyriologists which, for example, of the many cuneiform signs that have the reading 'du' actually occurs on the tablet. A particular sign can often be transcribed in a long way, such asdug4, or in a short way, such asdu11, because Sumerian was like French in omitting certain amissable final consonants except before a following vowel. Due to this lexicon's etymological orientation, you will usually find a word listed under its fullest phonetic form. Transcriptions of texts often contain the short forms, however, because Sumerologists try to accurately represent the spoken language. Short forms are listed, but you are told where to confer.

The vowels may be pronounced as follows: a as in father, u as in pull, e as in peg, and i as in hip. Of the special consonants, ñ is pronounced like ng in rang, þ is pronounced like ch in German Buch or Scottish loch, and š is pronounced like sh in dash .

Following the definitions, the lexicon may indicate in a smaller font the constituent elements of words that in origin were compound words, if those elements were clear to me. Etymologies are a normal part of dictionary- making, but etymologies are also the most subject to speculation. It is possible that, in some cases, I have provided a Sumerian etymology for what is actually a loanword from another language. I encourage scholars to contact me with evidence from productive roots in other proto-languages when they have reason to believe that a Sumerian word is a loan from another language family. In light of the Sumerian propensity for forming new words through compounding in the period after they invented cuneiform signs, it should not be surprising to find this same propensity in words dating from before their invention of written signs. The structure and thinking behind the Sumerian vocabulary is to me a thing of beauty. We are fortunate to be able to look back into the minds of our prehistoric ancestors and see how they thought and lived via the words that they created.
The lexicon's etymological orientation explains why the vocabulary is organized according to the phonetic structure of the words, with words sharing the same structure being listed together and alphabetically according to their final consonants and vowels, as this method best groups together related words. This principle has been abandoned after words of the structure CVC(V) in this version, as words that are phonetically more complex than

1
this do not group together by meaning. The phonetically more complex words and the compound words are listed alphabetically simply by their initial letters.

The tables above show signs used for simple syllables of the form CV or VC. As used for the 
Sumerian language, the cuneiform script was in principle capable of distinguishing at least 16 
consonants, transliterated as 

b, d, g, g , ḫ, k, l, m, n, p, r, ř, s, š, t, z 

as well as four vowel qualities: a, e, i, u.  ...[Wik] 

.. 

The picture of a hand came to stand not only for Sumerian šu (“hand”) but also for the phonetic 
syllable šu in any required context. Sumerian words were largely monosyllabic, so the signs 
generally denoted syllables, and the resulting mixture is termed a word-syllabic script. The 
inventory of phonetic symbols henceforth enabled the Sumerians to denote grammatical elements 
by phonetic complements added to the word signs (logograms or ideograms). Because Sumerian 
had many identical sounding (homophonous) words, several logograms frequently yielded identical 
phonetic values and are distinguished in modern transliteration—(as, for example, ba, bá, bà, ba4). 
Because a logogram often represented several related notions with different names (e.g., “sun,” 
“day,” “bright”), it was capable of assuming more than one phonetic value (this feature is called 
polyphony)...more

Foxvog's Basics  
http://home.comcast.net/~foxvog/Grammar.pdf] 

Sign Diacritics and Index Numbers  
Sumerian features a large number of homonyms — words that were pronounced  
similarly but had different meanings and were written with different signs,  
for example:  
 
 

/du/ 'to come, go' 𒁺  
/du/ 'to build'  𒆕 
/du/ 'to release'  𒂃  
A system of numerical subscripts, and diacritics over vowels representing  
subscripts, serves to identify precisely which sign appears in the actual  text Borger's index system  
which is used here is as follows:  
 

Single-syllable signs  

Multiple-syllable signs  
 du (= du1)  
 dú (= du2) 
  dù (= du3)  
  du4 etc.  
 muru  
 múru  
 mùru  
 muru4  
Note that the diacritic always falls on the first vowel of the word!  
There is variation in the systems employed in older signlists for multiple- syllable signs, especially 
in Labat. In the earliest editions of his sign-list which may still be encountered in libraries, Labat 
carried the use of diacritics through index numbers 4-5 by shifting the acute and grave accents onto 
the first syllable of multiple-syllable signs:  
 
murú (= muru2)  
murù (= muru3)  
múru (= muru4)  
mùru (= muru5)  

New values of signs, pronunciations for which no generally accepted index numbers yet exist, are 
given an "x" subscript, e.g. dax 'side'... 

Many signs are polyvalent, that is, they have more than one value or reading... 

... 

Polyvalency 
The most important new development by far was the principle of polyvalency, the  association of 
"many values" with a particular sign, each with its own separate  pronunciation. This became a very 
productive and simple method of generating  new logographic values. 

Determinatives  

To help the reader decide which possible value of a polyvalent sign was intended  by the writer, the 
use of determinatives arose. A determinative is one of a  limited number of signs which, when 
placed before or after a sign or group of  signs, indicates that the determined object belongs to a 
particular semantic  category, e.g. wooden, reed, copper or bronze objects, or persons, deities,  
places, etc. Determinatives were still basically optional as late as the Ur  III period (7887-7997CT). 
When Sumerian died as a spoken language, they became  obligatory. Determinatives were 
presumably not to be pronounced when a text  was read, and to show that they are not actually part 
of a word we transliterate  them, in unilingual Sumerian context at least, as superscripts. To use the  
example of the 'plow' sign above, the polyvalent sign APIN [see 𒀳] is read    

APIN - if preceded by a 'wood' determinative: GIŠAPIN 'plow'  
ENGAR - if preceded by a 'person' determinative: LÚENGAR 'plowman'  
but URU4 'to plow' or ÀBSIN 'furrow' elsewhere, depending upon context.  

Rebus Writing and Syllabic Values  

At some point rebus [cf. Kindle defi: a puzzle – words are rep by combo pictures and individual letters  e.g. 
apex = picture of ape + letter X shown by] writings arose, where the sign for an object which could  
easily be drawn was used to write a homophonous word which could not so easily  be depicted, 
especially an abstract idea. For example, the picture of an arrow,  pronounced /ti/, became also the 
standard sign for ti 'rib' as well as for the  verb ti(l) 'to live'. The adoption of the rebus principle was 
a great innova-  tion, but it adds to the difficulty of learning the Sumerian writing system,  since 
meanings of words thus written are divorced entirely from the original  basic shapes and meanings 
of their signs. 
...The Sumerian writing system was still in limited use as late as the [100th] cent.; the last known 
texts are astronomical in nature and can be dated  to ca. [10076CT]. The system thus served the 
needs of Mesopotamian civilizations for a continuous span of over 3200 years – a remarkable 
achievement in human history. 

Syllabic Signs  

Used in Sumerian primarily to write grammatical elements. They are also commonly used to write 
words for which there is no proper logogram. Sometimes this phonetic writing is a clue that the 
word in question is a foreign loanword. 

Determinatives    

Logograms which may appear before or after words which  categorize the latter in a variety of 
ways. They are orthographic aids and  were presumably not pronounced in actual speech. They 
begin to be used spora-  dically by the end of the archaic period. While they were probably 
developed  to help a reader chose the desired value of a polyvalent sign, they are often  employed 
obligatorily even when the determined logogram is not polyvalent.  For example, while the wood 
determinative ĝiš may be used before the PA sign  to help specify its reading ĝidri 'scepter', rather 
than, e.g., sìg 'to beat',  ĝiš is also used before hašhur 'apple (tree or wood)' even though this sign 
has  no other reading. Other common functions are to help the reader distinguish  between 
homonymous words, e.g. ad 'sound' and gišAD 'plank' or between different  related meanings of a 
word, e.g. nú 'to sleep' but gišĝèšnu (NÚ) 'bed'.   The following determinatives are placed BEFORE 
the words they determine and so  are referred to as pre-determinatives: 

The following determinatives are placed AFTER the words they determine and so are referred to as 
post-determinatives:

We have all these famous people. But how can we be sure they deserve the credit. “History is full of dead white 
males”. Often privileged with lots of family money and connections, one’s father was even ‘god’. The ones that 
weren’t so privileged were supposed to be natural geniuses – but a closer look shows that there is very little 
concrete historical evidence to support what they have supposed to have done – myth becomes fact, history re-
written. There really is no need to separate a Library into Fiction and Non-Fiction – it’s all Fiction. All this 
spinmeistering is to suit some group’s purpose, and usually becomes an established powerful money making 
industry, including Will Extortion of the gullible elderly, the "Tickets to Heaven" con job – leaving future 
generations dispossessed and invariably lined up at Centrelink.  

The “D.A.P. Score” is a formula for ranking people – an imposter exposer calculator, if you like. It is designed 
to weed out famous, influential people who have had a lot of help, to say the least. Each of the 3 variables has a 
maximum score of 10. So the total maximum score is 1000. 

You can calculate the DAP score for anybody, yourself or some famous figure. 

“D” = Degree of DIFFICULTY – in getting started / growing up, e.g. born into a 3rd world or advanced nation, 
poor or affluent family, well-grounded/stable or dysfunctional upbringing – alcoholic or caring parents, etc. 
So a very difficult start would score near 10, a very easy start, lots of assistance from family, connections, 
stable advanced economy would score near 0. 
Remember that if “D” is low or zero, there’s not much point in continuing further and analyzing the next 
variables “A” and “P” – because even if they are maximums you still end up with zilch: 0 x 10 x 10 = 0 

“A” = Degree of ACHIEVEMENT based on “D” (the degree of difficulty in getting started). 

“P” = Degree of POTENTIAL, essentially for ‘immortality’. 

Thus, in summary, DAP = D x A x P 

The maximum is 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 

Let’s now look at some examples: 

* William Shakspere 
William Shakspere (seems to have been spelt lots of different ways – we only have 6 dubious signatures - no 
letters or manuscripts, because he was likely illiterate) - held out to be William Shakespeare,the playwright, by 
the multi-billion dollar Stratford industry. Degree of Difficulty pretty average, didn’t achieve anything above 
the ordinary, but has a strong potential for immortality. Yep, the Establishment has credited him with the 
achievements of Edward de Vere. Just shows you if they can get away with re-writing history in this case, what 
else do they teach our children that has no sound foundation in a little thing called ‘reality’. 

William Shakspere’s – most likely pronounced ‘shack’ or ‘shax’ - de Vere used the name William Shake-
speare (it was often hyphenated as an extra clue for the coneys)  because of the similarity to the Pallas 

Athena goddess of Wisdom motif of shaking the spear at ignorance) and it neatly coincided as part of his coat 
of arms as Lord Bolbec :  
 Guillem Shaxper’s DAP score = 10 x 0 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000) 

* T.E. Lawrence 
 Probably blame Lowell Thomas (the American journalist commissioned by the government to get the wary 
public interested in sending their sons to the slaughter, he started out in the Western front stalemate, then had 
the bright idea to check out the Middle East campaign – and the first of several allied agents dressed in Arab 
costume that he saw … well, he could just see how it could be marketed). 
 Somewhat ’Difficult’ start – father runs off with maid, takes her name, which really means Lawrence is 
‘Chapman’ – finding out he was actually a bastard seems to have effected him; didn’t ’Achieve’ what 
Hollywood said he did – that was the Australian Light Horse; but he certainly does have the ‘Potential’ for 
immortality, if there’s an industry making money out of the ‘Myth as historical Fact‘ market. 

Ned’s (that’s what his family called him) DAP score = 5 x 0 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000) 

* Horus O’Nazareth 
One remembers hearing the Spanish pronunciation of “J” for the first time, then it hit me like the Droeshout 
engraving, a dead give away.  A lot of similarities to the way the Shakespeare Myth developed, no wonder they 
started getting nervous when it started shattering – so they had to fall back on the old faithful “Angra Mainyu 
( the original source of the evil one) put the fossils in the layers of sediment to fool the consumer”. They 
clearly plagiarized a mix of  Sumerian, Egyptian, Zoroastrian (confirmed by the Dead Sea Scrolls unearthing in 
'1956) and Buddhism mythologies. Despite all the detailed, yet spurious writings, written well after his time 
(generally, many would argue that, “no Paul – Roman CIA Agent to come up with a way to stop the violent 
freedom fighters, no Horus the ‘turn the other cheek / it’s cool being poor’ Buddhist motif”), there is very little 
objective evidence of his existence, let alone deeds. In spite of comandeering Civilization’s year counting 
system, e.g. 2013 AD, that is supposed to be based on his birth year, no-one knows his year of birth, nor the 
date – December 25, being a rip-off of the sun god’s birthday, the festival of much older cultures, based on the 
northern hemisphere winter solstice. Yet the hierarchy and associated billion dollar industry hold out the 25th 
December to be the original factual historical birthday – “It’s written down there somewhere, by someone who 
was there, heck we have all the other details, of course they jotted down the date too” – next time you chat to 
someone high up that gets chauffered around, ask them for a page reference.  
So now the majority of the world’s population is lumped with a calendar system based on a (tax 
exempt) religion - thereby not constitutionally keeping a ‘Separation of (someone else’s) church and State’. 
And there is strong archaeological evidence (only discovered within the last 160 years) that much of 
the spiel has been plagiarized from these much older cultures, especially Sumer (Iraq) and Egypt. Like  ‘The 
Gilgamesh Epic’ – the oldest story written on clay tablets – including the original flood story. 
And of course the Egyptian Horus myth. Actually since Alexandria, Egypt is the true home of 
the Civilization’s Calendar (including the modern version developed by Sosigenes), and the recent epochal 
rebirth of Egypt, they should be put back in charge of the Calendar. 
The new Egypt Democratice government should make it their first submission to the United Nations: for the 
first time, a true international calendar. A non sectarian one – simply Civilization Time - starting at the true 
beginning of Civilization at the end of the last ice age that allowed the first villages cum Cities, no longer 
relegating the great Egypt, Sumer (originally black-headed people probably from East Africa who hopped 
across the Arabian Gulf), Indus and China cultures to ancient sounding BC status, - to be used on all 
international records – 2013 Anno Domini (latin for Year Domination) years since ‘what’ (there’s no historical 
record of anything happening in 1AD, whoever theirGuillem Shaksper figurehead was based on had to be born 

at least by 4BC) of the current religio Western dominated plagiarized calendar to, add the forgotten 10,000 
years = 𒀓CT 

Aren’t we supposed to be teaching our children not to Plagiarize someone else’s stuff? 

In any event, moving onto the DAP analysis: The “D” score. It seems that he had perfect parents (something 
few of us have) and a ‘close’ connection to ‘god’ – a pretty useful connection. And it may even be argued, that 
his success / achievement was pre-destined – all setup, a forgone conclusion. 
So even before getting to the “A” and “P” scores, the “D” score and therefore the overall DAP is looking pretty 
close to zero. Thus, a rough ‘prima facie’ guess would throw up: 

Horus o’N DAP score = 0 x 10 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000) 

* Bill Gates 
Has the strong potential to be the richest man that will ever live. 

His “D” score: born into an advanced nation, affluent family line, and again, given the achievement bug by his 
grandmother. 
A closer look at the development of Microsoft shows that it if not for, Paul Allen, Bill Gates would be still 
trying to graduate from Harvard. It was Allen that first identified the seed of the future Microsoft. And much of 
the later software, that fueled the exponential development was essentially plagiarized. 
So again we have a “D” score approaching 0. 

Thus, a rough ‘prima facie’ guess would throw up: 

Bill Gate’s DAP score = 0 x 10 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000) 

* Former President Bill Clinton 
His “D” score: He was born into an advanced nation, didn’t know his biological father, mother wasn’t around 
much. But he was essentially raised by his grandmother, who had the time and inclination to give him lots of 
attention and instill a learning / achievement bug in his brain. His step father, whose name he would later take, 
was very influential in Arkansas. And many would say Hillary Rodham Clinton was, and is, a key driving force 
in his success. 
So, in spite of his rise to the presidency, a major achievement, from seemingly humble beginnings, giving a 
high, even approaching a maximum “A” score, his “D” on close analysis is appears to be paradoxicallly low. 
And his “P” score, given the scandals, etc. is probably also very low. 

Thus, a rough ‘prima facie’ guess would throw up: 

Bill Clinton’s DAP Score = 2 x 10 x 1 = 20 (just 2% of a maximum 1000) 

* Former President George II 
Well, I think you can calculate that one. 

* Albert Einstein 
The “D” score: born into an advanced nation, reasonably affluent family, considerable useful influence came 
from his uncle, excellent academic environment / facilities, and a first wife that may well have played a greater 

role than we will ever know. 
The “A” and “P” scores are pretty obvious. 

Thus, a rough ‘prima facie’ guess would throw up: 

Albert Einstein’s DAP score = 7 x 10 x 10 = 700 (70% of a maximum 1000) 

* James Watson 
James Watson along with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins shot to fame, including the ’1962 Nobel Prize for 
their structure of DNA – the double helix, but they lifted the work of Rosalind Franklin (b. 25 July ’1920).  

She was the ultimate loser, dying of cancer at age 38 in ’1958 (talk about bad luck!) never knowing just how 
much her colleagues ripped her off, because to them she was just a stupid female. The plagiarists basked in 
their sham glory past their 80s. Refer p563-8 Science – A History, John Gribbin, and the “Rosalind Franklin – 
The Dark Lady of DNA“, Brenda Maddox) 

James Watson’s DAP score = 0 x 0 x 10 = 0 (0% of a maximum 1000) 

* * * 

To finish on a positive note: 

* Charles ‘Hank’ Bukowski 
Bukowski had a shitty start, but stumbled on to John Martin, who himself commands a high DAP score. In a 
sense the two men are inextricably coupled for eternity. 

Bukowski’s DAP score = 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 (100% of a maximum 1000) 

* “Billjim“ 
This one is still being played out. 

Billjim DAP score = 10 x 10 x ? = [remains to be seen - are plebs becoming empowered enough with the Internet?]

I appreciate the concept.  Very eloquently organized.
