One important bridgehead of the urban formation period was [Tell Zeidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Zeidan) south of the Caucasus. In the last decade the scolary opinion has flipped the signs in that now it is believed that Sumerian technology came from the north. (Kingship came from the mountains according to Sumerian tradition).

*Traces of Old Egyptian in Eurasian languages*  

To linguists in the 19th centuries it came as a revelation when they discovered that the old Persian and Sanscrit words for family members were virtually identical to [European](PIE) variants:  

cuneiform|transcribed|english|letters  
--|--|--|--  
𐎶𐎠𐎫𐎠			|MaTa 	|mother  |𐎶=M 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎱𐎡𐎫𐎠			|PiTa	|father  |𐎱=P 𐎡=I 𐎫=T 𐎠=A

*𐎯𐎧𐎬𐎠		|Duxtua	|daughter  
𐎱𐎢𐏂			|Pučun  | puer/son  

Even now, 2500 years after Persians hammered those words into stone, the Iranian(Farsi) words are almost identical, surviving an Arabian conquest and millenia of separation, but reinforced by international relationships and intermarriages:

This (re)discovery lead to well established theories of [proto-indoeuropean](PIE) expansions. Here we investigate the relationship between these [pioneers](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) and the Pharaonic Egyptian language and culture.  

First we take a step back to the region where the PIE journey begun: The countries surrounding the black sea.

In 5000BC the **Danube [Vinča civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture)** pioneered advanced copper technology, in 4200BC Romanian [Varna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_culture) hordes contain more gold artefacts than all other sites of that time combined, turning a formerly egalitarian society into a more violent one lead by an **elite**.

Danube copper kings conquering the world.  

Only recently has the caucasian [Maykop culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture) been redated to begin at 4000BC. As it contains more gold and artefacts from Sumer() than the whole rest of Mesopotamia, its central position in the formation of urbanization becomes more and more evident. Especially as it connects our [European roots](PIE) with the two great civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Their [kurgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan) mounts, some still reaching over 50 meters height, can be seen as predecessors of Egyptian, [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepe_Sialk) and [Peruvian pyramids](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caral), which appeared some thousand years later. Central to this revolution were a bag of inventions, including *metallurgy*, brewing, proto-*writing*, *«kingship»* and the ***sail*** boat, which became a cult object in the [Ubaid period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period) -3800BC. The horse/donkey/bull *cart* appeared about the same time. This [Curgan Copper Conquest](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) reached Egypt comparatively late, though one of its watermarks, industrial brewing, can be found as early as 3700BC.  

The roots of the Persian language came via the region of Elam with its capital Susa on the eastern border of Sumeria. Strikingly the cultural artefacts of Egypt and Susa were nearly identical:  

![susa-egypt.png](susa-egypt.png)  
Near identical building plans of the early temples and very similar early Egyptian and Sumerian [ceremonies](Hieros-gamos) clearly demonstrate that these are not mere trade-artefacts, but in fact proof of a common anchestry of both higher civilizations.  
Some context of this urbanization can be explored in the paper the [Kurgan Copper Revolution](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution). Here we investigate how deeply the roots go and how the [system](PIE), its [cosmology](cosmos) and language are intertwined with our own:  

Is there a sound combining t and k? that would 

We subscribe to the idea that central words of frequent use and large semantic clusters have a much lower probability of mutating then other words, similar to ultra-conserved genes.

Remember the persian words for mother and father?  
Here are the (deified) Egyptian variants:

Over the course of 3000 years, many dialects and some conquests, the precise sound of vowels is probably unrecoverably lost. Its rendering in transcritions is therefore a matter of convention, suggestion or artistic choice but should be ignored for linguistic studies. Which would make some endeavours pretty hopeless if it wasn't for the existence of large clusters. For instance gab, kaf,… in semitic languages means hand and there a hundreds of words with g-b k-f c-v stems which all mean something related to 'cover'. An open mind would consider that this strong root is connected with IE variants (Koffer...), and maybe even with caput(head) geben give …

We know very little about how the vowels between consonants actually sounded like, often they are omitted and only a(r) (f)e (y)i and (w)u(n) are used regularily. 

That looks more dire than it sounds: Sometimes the nature of a vowel can be estimated from context. 
𓈖 'n' is somewhat related to nile, nau/navi(water) nun(fish) nar(fish) eliminating at least some parts of the vowel manifold. But then it could also be related to mem(water) mnemn meander mar mwater.

For exampel [[𓍢]] 𓏲 (meaning hundred) can be read as round wound houn(dreh), which gives whr plus a ou sound. related words wend wind bend band have other signs, though they appear together.

On the other hand some vowels appear to have consonant which are lost in the reconstruction, leading to bizarre words like a.a.a  
We try to contribute to the reconstruction of some phonetics, though some words must be viewed as working hypothesis.

Using the Egyptian [alphabet](Alphabet) in its late form, which is preserved to us by comparisons to the derived coptic and demotic languages, as well as comparisons to greek and semitic languages. {[read](Alphabet) if you are German}

This Discovery is not entirely new, Dr. Christian De Vartavan, former head of the Armenian Egyptology Centre released several [papers](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiA0MjT2dDYAhUEJlAKHa-8C0MQFggzMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academia.edu%2F357726%2FSeveral_Ancient_Egyptian_numerals_are_cognates_of_Indo_European_or_Proto_Indo_European_equivalents&usg=AOvVaw0RUWGKPhtGirffrH_29yU6) on the subject. In fact this observation was more widely spread before the second world war, after which it became taboo. Either because the Nazis abused the Indo-Europaen data for their ideology, or because of the undeniable strong connections between Egyptian and Semitic languages; the later however is not a contradiction:  

Egyptian could be related to Afrosemitic *and* Eurasian languages.  

In the past linguists focussed on demonstrating that Afrosemitic languages are the mothers of Egyptian.  
In the future it should be reexamined whether the fathers came from further north. Even before the arrival of the charriot.

We propose to slightly alter the reading of  
*) '𓍿' to be centered in the middle of the distribution t-th-c-ⵛ (kappa), so in the proximity of 'tc'.  
*) '𓅱','𓍢' (w/u) to contain a dangling 'n' so (w)hun, 𓏲⋍ə.

In general one should think of those signs as distributions, so 𓃀 is somewhere on the axis p-ph-bh-b-pf-f, the exact pronunciation was probably dependent on dialects and words. The german Bein for '𓃀' conveniently lives in the middle of this distribution, the original reading could have been closer to spanish pierna.  

Fortunately well recognisable words and clusters make the situation less dire than it would seem.
