If you order a product or service that we offer for sale through the Services, we may also collect and maintain your billing address, shipping address, product selections, and your order number.&nbsp;In order to take advantage of certain functionalities of certain Services, such as the ability to purchase certain products or services, our third party payment processor may collect certain financial information from you, such as your name, address, credit or debit card information or ACH information, applicable card expiration dates and security codes in order to process your transactions. We do not collect, store or otherwise maintain this financial information, including credit, debit or similar information from individuals who make purchases using the Services, and use and storage of that information is governed by the payment processor\u2019s applicable terms of service and privacy policy.<\/p><p>You do not have a statutory or contractual obligation to provide us with your information; however, if you do not provide us with your information, we may not be able to provide you with the Services you have requested or you may be limited in your use of our Services (e.g., if you do not provide us with your email address, we will not be able to send you newsletters).<\/p><h3>B. Information that is Passively or Automatically Collected<\/h3><h4>1. Device\/Usage Information<\/h4><p>We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices or tablets) you use to access the Services. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information such as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP\/IP address, and other information about your computer or device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, mobile device carrier information, the state or country from which you accessed the Services; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content (such as advertisements) viewed and the order of those pages, statistical information about the use of the Services (such as barcodes scanned through certain of our mobile apps), the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error logs, and other similar information.&nbsp;As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.<\/p><p>We also collect and analyze information from your browser or device, such as, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, resolution and other data, for purposes of creating a unique profile or \u201cfingerprint\u201d of your browser or device.

If you access the Services through a mobile device, we may also ask you to share your specific geo-location information with us. The Services use this location information to provide customized location-based services, content, promotional offers and other information that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;For example, if you use our ShopSavvy mobile application, with your permission, we collect geolocation information from your device that will allow us to present location-based alerts such as nearby retailers or coupons, or organize products searched or scans based on the closest applicable retailer.&nbsp;We may also use location information to improve the functionality of the Services and our other products services.&nbsp;We and our service providers may also collect other information based on your location and your device\u2019s proximity to \u201cbeacons\u201d and other similar indoor proximity systems, including, for example, the strength of the signal between the \u201cbeacon\u201d and your device and the duration that your device is near the \u201cbeacon.\u201d&nbsp;If you do not wish to have this location information collected and used by us and our service providers, you may disable the location features on your device.&nbsp;Please note that if you disable such features, you will not be able to access or receive some or all of the services, content, features and\/or products made available via the Services.&nbsp;Also see the \u201cTailored Advertising\u201d section below for more choices regarding the delivery of interest-based content and advertising.<\/p><h4>3.&nbsp;Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies<\/h4><p>We and our service providers may also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server logs, cookies and\/or tracking pixels.

Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and\/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods. We also gather information and identify users through the fingerprinting methods described in Section 2(a) above.<\/p><p>We and our service providers use the following cookies:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies.<\/strong> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website.

This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.<\/li><li><strong>Functionality cookies.<\/strong> These are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).<\/li><li><strong>Targeting cookies.<\/strong> These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests.

WHEN WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION<\/h2><p>Purch may disclose and\/or share your information between members of the Purch corporate group, and to or with any non-affiliated third parties under the following circumstances:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Consent.<\/strong>&nbsp;We may disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so.<\/li><li><strong>Service Providers.<\/strong>&nbsp;We may provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf and for any other legitimate business purpose. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, customer support, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services.<\/li><li><strong>Business Partners.<\/strong>&nbsp;We may provide your information to individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships to provide you with special coupons, discounts, or promotions, or to offer products and services to you for purchase. We encourage these partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.<\/li><li><strong>Protection of Purch and Others.<\/strong> By using the Services, you acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your information, including, but not limited to, any user content, if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.purch.com\/terms-of-use\/\">Terms of Service<\/a>, this Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; and\/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Purch, its agents and affiliates, its users and\/or the public.&nbsp;This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam\/malware prevention, and similar purposes.<\/li><li><strong>Business Transfers.<\/strong> As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions, e.g., due diligence) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of Purch\u2019s assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.<\/li><li><strong>Public Forums.<\/strong>&nbsp;Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs and community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Please also remember that if you choose to provide information on public features of the Services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it\u2019s information you want to share with the public.<\/li><\/ul><h2>4. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA<\/h2><p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing your personal data are as follows:<\/p><ul><li><strong>To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You.<\/strong> Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our customers, or to take steps at customers\u2019 request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.<\/li><li><strong>Legitimate Interests.<\/strong> In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities such as the following in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals:<\/li><li>Customer service<\/li><li>Marketing<\/li><li>Protecting our customers, personnel and property<\/li><li>Analyzing and improving our business<\/li><li>Managing legal issues<\/li><\/ul><p>We may also process personal data for the same legitimate interests of our customers and business partners.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Legal Compliance.<\/strong> We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.<\/li><li><strong>Consent.<\/strong> Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent. Where we handle your personal data on the basis of consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.<\/li><\/ul><h2>5. PERSONALIZED CONTENT AND ADVERTISING<\/h2><h3>A. Online and Email Analytics<\/h3><p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics.&nbsp;These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the \u201cCookies and other electronic technologies\u201d section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. For example, the Google Trusted Store badge displayed on some of the Services is served to you through the use of cookies. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services.&nbsp;We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/tools.google.com\/dlpage\/gaoptout\">clicking here.<\/a><\/p><p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.&nbsp;This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.<\/p><h3>B. Tailored Online and Mobile Advertising<\/h3><p>We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.<\/p><p>In connection with the foregoing, we work with DigiTrust to set a first-party cookie in your browser to enable us and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitru.st\/participating-companies\/\">DigiTrust&nbsp;Partners<\/a>to collect web viewing data that includes visits to the Services and non-affiliated websites over time. This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences. Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the services (e.g., user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies, including DigiTrust, may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.networkadvertising.org\/choices\">Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out link<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aboutads.info\/choices\/\">Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out link<\/a> , the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youronlinechoices.com\/%20\">opt-out page of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/preferences-mgr.truste.com\/\">TrustArc\u2019s Preference Manager<\/a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through the Services.<\/p><p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/tools.google.com\/dlpage\/gaoptout\">Google Ads Settings page<\/a>. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored.<\/p><p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and\/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements. For any other devices and\/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. We also may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics.&nbsp;You can opt-out from third-party interest-based advertising on some Android devices and Google apps by visiting Google Settings, Ads and then click on \u2018Disable ads based on interests.\u2019&nbsp;You can also opt out of some interest-based advertising on your mobile device by downloading the TrustArc Privacy App available at:&nbsp;https:\/\/www.trustarc.com\/consumer-resources\/privacy-app\/.<\/p><p>Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. n that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.&nbsp; We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.<\/p><h3>C. Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals<\/h3><p>Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform online services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or services.

MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION<\/strong><\/p><p>13.1 Modification of Services.&nbsp;Purch reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof), with or without notice. You agree that Purch shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services.<\/p><p>13.2 Termination. These Terms are effective unless and until terminated by you or us. We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, deny you access to all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason at all, with or without notice to you. Grounds for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (a) breaches or violations of these Terms or other agreements, (b) requests by law enforcement or government agencies, (c) discontinuance or material modification of the Services (or any part thereof), (d) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (e) extended periods of inactivity (f) activities related to protecting the rights, property or safety of Purch, its agents and affiliates, its users and the public; or (g) if you provide any information, including registration information, that is false, inaccurate, out-of-date, or incomplete. If we terminate for no reason your right to access the Services, we will fulfill our obligations to you related to any order outstanding at the time of termination. If you terminate your account, you will remain liable under these Terms for any purchase made prior to termination. If we terminate your right to access the Services, these Terms will terminate and all rights you have to access the Services will immediately terminate; however, certain provisions of these Terms will still apply post termination, including without limitation, the Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions. Termination of your account may also include, at Purch\u2019s sole discretion, the deletion of your account and\/or User Content.<\/p><p><strong>14. MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER<\/strong><\/p><p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.<\/p><p>14.1 Application. You and Purch agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section 14 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.<\/p><p>14.2 Initial Dispute Resolution. Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at <a href=\"mailto:storesupport@purch.com\">storesupport@purch.com<\/a>, and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account). Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Purch, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.<\/p><p>14.3 Binding Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, (except as provided in section 14.7 below) subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms\u2019 formation, performance, and breach), the parties\u2019 relationship with each other, and\/or your use of Purch shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.<\/p><p>14.4 Arbitrator\u2019s Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator\u2019s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.<\/p><p>14.5 Filing a Demand. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (b) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco California 94111; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at Purch, Attn: Legal Department, 11 West 42nd&nbsp;Street, 15th&nbsp;Floor, New York, NY 10036.<\/p><p>To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Purch will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Purch will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys\u2019 fees unless the arbitration rules and\/or applicable law provide otherwise.<\/p><p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. Arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration.<\/p><p>14.6 Class Action Waiver. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party\u2019s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND PURCH AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.<\/p><p>14.7 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties\u2019 decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (\u201cintellectual property rights\u201d means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court\u2019s jurisdiction.<\/p><p>14.8 30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to at <a href=\"mailto:storesupport@purch.com\">storesupport@purch.com<\/a> with the subject line, \u201cARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.\u201d The notice must be sent within thirty days of your first use of the Services. Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Purch also will not be bound by them.<\/p><p>14.9 Changes to This Section: Purch will provide thirty (30) days\u2019 notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Services. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Services or sent to you by email. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on \u201cChanges to This Section\u201d is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.<\/p><p>14.10 Survival. This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of Purch Perks.<\/p><p><strong>15. Controlling Law and Severability<\/strong><\/p><p>These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. If any part of these Terms is considered invalid, it shall be enforced as effectively as possible while all other provisions remain in full effect.<\/p><p><strong>16. GENERAL TERMS<\/strong><\/p><p>16.1 Force Majeure. Under no circumstances shall Purch or its licensor or supplier be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from an event beyond its reasonable control.<\/p><p>16.2 No Waiver; Severability. No waiver of any term of these Terms will be binding unless in writing, no waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the failure of Purch to exercise or enforce any right or remedy in these Terms does not waive that right or remedy. If an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.<\/p><p>16.3 Third-Party Beneficiaries. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.<\/p><p>16.4 Miscellaneous. These Terms (and all terms and conditions incorporated herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Purch and govern your use of the Services, Services and products provided by Purch, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Purch on the subject matter. These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may not be assigned or delegated by you. These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may be assigned or delegated by Purch without restriction. These Terms bind and inure to the benefit of each party and the party\u2019s successors and permitted assigns. These Terms may not be modified by an oral statement by a representative of Purch. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by these Terms. You agree that any agreements made by and between you and us in electronic form are as legally binding as if made in physical written form. These Terms will not be construed against the drafter. \u201cInclude(s)\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d means, respectively, \u201cinclude(s) without limitation\u201d or \u201cincluding without limitation\u201d, unless expressly stated otherwise. If you are using the Services for or on behalf of the U.S. government, your license rights do not exceed those granted to non-government consumers. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.<\/p><p>16.5 Notices. We may deliver notice to you by e-mail, posting a notice on the Services or any other method we choose and such notice will be effective on dispatch. If you give notice to us, it will be effective when received and you must use the following physical or email address: (1) Purch, 11 West 42nd&nbsp;Street, 15th&nbsp;Floor, New York, NY 10036; or (2) <a href=\"mailto:storesupport@purch.com\">storesupport@purch.com<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>17.
