The Egyptian Hieroglyphic writing system  started as a syllabary[➾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary) but soon converged to a rather small set of frequent signs&sounds plus «determinants» (like [𓈉](𓈉) for land).  

Babylon is written [𓃀](𓃀)[𓃀](𓃀)[𓂋](𓂋)[𓏤](𓏤)[𓈉](𓈉) b.b.l.[1](Numbers)(𓈉land)  
'L' 𓂋 «lense» «el'lips» is normally read as  
'R' 𓂋 «round»  («rot» = mouth in Russian = the meaning of the sign)  

Barbarion or not, the Egyptian letter 'b' [𓃀](𓃀) looks almost like a flipped modern 'b' in writing (both writing directions were common initially). The word '𓃀' itself is cognate with [european](PIE) variants: Bein, pierna, pod, foot, …  

Every single letter in this “[Alphabet](Alphabet)” of Egyptian hieroglyphs left a tremendous linguistic footprint on most surrounding and quite distant extinct and extant languages  

and [conventional reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration_of_Ancient_Egyptian#Table_of_transliteration_schemes) of the signs, with the exception of letter 'f' pth [𓆑](𓆑) vs [𓇋](𓇋)e.

Many of the characters influenced modern alphabets.

It is important to note that the cognates here are naturally chosen from english and german, yet because of the deep connections within proto-indo-european it would have in many cases also been possible to a pick say Spanish or Russian variants. Also since linguists have shown the closeness of Egyptian to semitic languages, one has to view Egyptian as bridge between these two [Eurasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasiatic_languages) superfamilies.
