The Uluburun Shipwreck is a Late Bronze Age shipwreck dated to the late 14th century BC,[1] discovered close to the east shore of Uluburun (Grand Cape), and about 6 miles southeast of Kaş, in south-western Turkey.[2] The shipwreck was discovered in the summer of 1982 by Mehmed Çakir, a local sponge diver from Yalıkavak, a village near Bodrum.

Eleven consecutive campaigns of three to four months' duration took place from 1984 to 1994 totaling 22,413(!!) dives, revealing one of the most spectacular Late Bronze Age assemblages to have emerged from the Mediterranean Sea[3]

Cargo

    This is a list of the cargo as described by Pulak (1998).

The Uluburun ship’s cargo consisted mostly of raw materials that were trade items, which before the ship’s discovery were known primarily from ancient texts or Egyptian tomb paintings. The cargo matches many of the royal gifts listed in the Amarna letters found at El-Amarna, Egypt.

    Copper and tin ingots
        Raw copper cargo totaling ten tons, consisting of a total of 354 ingots of the oxhide (rectangular with handholds extending from each corner) type.
        Out of the total amount of ingots at least 31 unique two-handled ingots were identified that were most likely shaped this way to assist the process of loading ingots onto specially designed saddles or harnesses for ease of transport over long distances by pack animals.
        121 copper bun and oval ingots.
        The oxhide ingots were originally stowed in 4 distinct rows across the ship’s hold, which either slipped down the slope after the ship sank or shifted as the hull settled under the weight of the cargo.
        Approximately one ton of tin (when alloyed with the copper would make about 11 tons of bronze).
        Tin ingots were oxhide and bun shaped.
    Canaanite jars and Pistacia resin
        At least 149 Canaanite jars (widely found in Greece, Cyprus, Syria-Palestine, and Egypt).
        Jars are categorized as the northern type and were most likely made somewhere in the northern part of modern-day Israel.
        One jar filled with glass beads, many filled with olives, but the MAJORITY contained a substance known as Pistacia (terebinth) resin, an ancient type of TURPENTINE.
        Recent clay fabric analyses of Canaanite jar sherds from the 18th-Dynasty site of Tell el-Amarna have produced a specific clay fabric designation, and it is seemingly the same as that from the Uluburun shipwreck, of a type that is exclusively associated in Amarna with transporting Pistacia resin.

    Glass ingots
        Approximately 175 glass ingots of cobalt blue turquoise and lavender were found (earliest intact glass ingots known).
        Chemical composition of cobalt blue glass ingots matches those of contemporary Egyptian core-formed vessels and Mycenaean pendant beads, which suggests a common source.

Linear C:
Cypro-Minoan inscription were [clarification needed] separated from the earliest texts in Linear A by less than a century, yet the Cypro-Minoan script at its earliest stage was much different from Linear A: it contained only syllabic signs while Linear A and its descendant Linear B both contained multiple ideograms, and its form was adapted to writing on clay while Linear A was better suited to writing with ink. It is noteworthy that the Linear B script that emerged a century later still retained many more features from, and most of the signary of, Linear A. All this evidence indicates a one-time introduction rather than long-time development. (?)
The earliest inscriptions are dated about 1550 BC.

It is noteworthy that the Cypro-Minoan script was absent in some Bronze Age cities of Cyprus, yet abundant in others.

Unlike many other neighboring states, the Bronze Age collapse had only a slight impact on Cyprus; in fact, the period immediately following the dramatic events of the collapse was the flourishing of the island culture, with visible increase of use of the script in such centers as Enkomi. On the other hand, as a direct result of this collapse, the script ceased to exist in Ugarit, together with the polis itself. Since then, the number of Greek artifacts gradually increases in the Cypriot context, and around 950 BC the Cypro-Minoan script suddenly disappears, being soon substituted by the new Cypriot syllabary, whose inscriptions represent mainly the Greek language, with just a few short texts in Eteocypriot language.

Maybe related: Cretan 'hieroglyphics' (Phaistos...) 

Cretan 'hieroglyphics' 
predates Linear A by about a century, but the two writing systems continued to be used in parallel for most of their history. 2100–1700 BC !
Parent systems: Proto-writing  /  Egyptian inspiration!
Corpus is composed of two distinct parts:
    Seals and sealings (ca. 150 documents)
    Other documents (mainly archival inscriptions) inscribed on clay (ca. 120 documents).

Some Cretan Hieroglyphic (as well as Linear A) inscriptions were also found on the island of Samothrace in the northeastern Aegean.[4] !

It has been suggested that there was an evolution of the hieroglyphs into the linear scripts. Also, some relations to Anatolian hieroglyphs have been suggested.

    The overlaps between the Cretan script and other scripts, such as the hieroglyphic scripts of Cyprus and the Hittite lands of Anatolia, may suggest ... that they all evolved from a common ancestor, a now-lost script perhaps originating in Syria.[5]

There is a land called Crete in the midst of the wine-blue sea,
a beautiful and fertile land, seagirt; in it are many
people, innumerable, and there are ninety cities.
Language with language is mingled together. There are Akhaians,
there are great-hearted Eteocretans, there are Kydones,
and Dorians in their three clans, and noble Pelasgians.
[Homer, Odyssey 19, lines 172 - 177]

Akhaians <> Archaic Acha-Aegaeans Aegy:Hagia/Holy?
Dorians	<> gold? << Darius I ? <> Dorians~SLAVE! <> Jewish rebellion
Pelasgians <> Phallas (m)Aries

Of them [the peoples in the above passage] Staphylos says that the Dorians occupy the region towards the east, the Kydones the western part, the Eteocretans the southern, whose town is Prasos, where the temple of Diktaian Zeus is; and that the Eteocretans and Kydones are probably indigenous, but the others incomers, ....

There are five inscriptions which can be attributed Eteocretan, two of them being bilingual Eteocretan and Greek. though written in Greek alphabets, are clearly not Greek. These inscriptions date from the late 7th or early 6th century down to the 3rd century BC. The language, which is not understood, is probably a survival of a language spoken on Crete before the arrival of Greeks and may or may not be derived from the Minoan language preserved in the Linear A inscriptions of a millennium earlier. Since that language remains untranslated, it is not certain that Eteocretan and Minoan are related. EGAL!

The Hattians spoke Hattic, a non-Indo-European language of uncertain affiliation. Hattic is now believed by some scholars to be related to the Northwest Caucasian language group.[2] Trevor Bryce writes:

    Evidence of a 'Hattic' civilization is provided by the remnants of one of the non-Indo-European languages found in the later Hittite archives.The language is identified in several of the texts in which it appears by the term hattili- '(written) in the language of Hatti.' The few texts that survive are predominantly religious or cultic in character. They provide us with the names of a number of Hattic deities, as well as Hattic personal and place-names.[3]

Metropolis =
MATRO.POLIS

"It were as though a Greek fringe has been woven about the shores of the barbarians."

If a Greek city was sending out a colony, an oracle, especially one such as the Oracle of Delphi, was almost invariably consulted beforehand. Sometimes certain classes of citizens were called upon to take part in the enterprises; sometimes one son was chosen by lot from every house where there were several sons; and strangers expressing a desire to join were admitted. 

A person of distinction was selected to guide the emigrants and make the necessary arrangements.
!!

It was usual to honor these founders of colonies, after their death, as heroes. Some of the sacred fire was taken from the public hearth in the Prytaneum, from which the fire on the public hearth of the new city was kindled. 

And, just as each individual had his private shrines, so the new community maintained the worship of its chief domestic deities, the colony sending embassies and votive gifts to the mother-city's principal festivals for centuries afterwards.

The relation between colony and mother-city, known literally as the metropolis, was viewed as one of mutual affection.

Any differences that arose were resolved by peaceful means whenever possible, war being deemed excusable only in cases of extreme necessity. LOYALty lieu~kin

pay tribute in religious centres, like Delphi, Olympia or Delos.

The cleruchs (κληροῦχοι, klêrouchoi) formed a special class of Greek colonists, each being assigned an individual plot of land (κλῆρος, klêros) in the place to which they had been assigned. The trade factories set up in foreign countries, such as Egypt, were somewhat different from the ordinary colonies, the members retaining the right of domicile in their own fatherland and confining themselves to their own quarter in the foreign city.

ROME
The duty of leading the colonists and founding the settlement was entrusted to a commission usually consisting of three members. These men continued to stand in the relation of patrons (patroni) to the colony after its foundation. The colonists entered the conquered city in military array, preceded by banners, and the foundation was celebrated with special solemnities.

capturing = 'founding' !!!

The coloniae were free from taxes, and had their own constitution, a copy of the Roman, electing from their own body their Senate and other officers of State.

From the time of the Gracchi the colonies lost their MILITARY CHARACTER.

Southmost extend of PIE:

The names of the Mitanni aristocracy frequently are of Indo-Aryan origin, but it is specifically their deities which show Indo-Aryan roots (Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Nasatya), though some think that they are more immediately related to the Kassites.[12] The common people's language, the Hurrian language, is neither Indo-European nor Semitic.[13] Hurrian is related to Urartian, the language of Urartu, both belonging to the Hurro-Urartian language family. It had been held that nothing more can be deduced from current evidence.[14] A Hurrian passage in the Amarna letters – usually composed in Akkadian, the lingua franca of the day – indicates that the royal family of Mitanni was by then speaking Hurrian as well.

Bearers of names in the Hurrian language are attested in wide areas of Syria and the northern Levant that are clearly outside the area of the political entity known to Assyria as HANILGALBAT. 

 In the 14th century BC numerous city-states in northern Syria and Canaan were ruled by persons with Hurrian and some Indo-Aryan names.

 Differences in dialect and regionally different pantheons (Hepat/Shawushka, Sharruma/Tilla etc.) point to the existence of several groups of Hurrian speakers.



No native sources for the history of Mitanni have been found so far. The account is mainly based on Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian sources, as well as inscriptions from nearby places in Syria. Often it is not even possible to establish synchronicity between the rulers of different countries and cities, let alone give uncontested absolute dates. 

Kassite dynasty of the Babylonian Empire,

The Kassites (/ˈkæsaɪts/) were a people of the ancient Near East, who controlled Babylonia after the fall of the Old Babylonian Empire c. 1531 BC and until c. 1155 BC (short chronology). The endonym of the Kassites was probably Galzu,[1] although they have also been referred to by the names Kaššu, Kassi, Kasi or Kashi.

CYPERN

In 2004, the remains of an 8-month-old cat were discovered buried with its human owner at a Neolithic archeological site in Cyprus.[4] The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, predating Egyptian civilization and pushing back the earliest known feline-human association significantly.[5]

The aceramic civilisation of Cyprus came to an end quite abruptly around 6000 BC. It was probably followed by a vacuum of almost 1,500 years until around 4500 BC when one sees the emergence of Neolithic II (Ceramic Neolithic)!! i
3500 BC appearance of the first metalwork and the beginning of the Chalcolithic (copper and stone) period that lasted until about 2500/2300 BC. Very few chisels, hooks and jewellery of pure copper have survived, but in one example there is a minimal presence of tin, something which may support contact! with Asia Minor.

The presence of a stamp seal, copper is still rare.

The Chalcolithic period did not come to an end at the same time throughout Cyprus, and lingered in the Paphos area until the arrival of the Bronze Age.

The new era was introduced by people from ANATOLIA who came to Cyprus about 2400 BC: Philia Culture. 
Red Polished Ware, usually traced to Cilicia. Finds of this type of pottery have also been found in other areas of the middle east including at Tarsus, Troy (Hisarlik) and others in western Anatolia.

"As the newcomers knew how to work with copper they soon moved to the so-called copperbelt of the island, that is the foothills of the Troodos mountains." colony!!

Cyprus <> copper !

houses were rectangular with many rooms, with lanes allowing people to move freely in the community.
At the end of the Middle Bronze Age fortresses were built in various places, a clear indication of unrest.

Cyprus was known as Al.asiya, the name is preserved in Egyptian, Hittite, Assyrian, Ugaritic documents.
Asia! BROAD 'Hasen' ethnonym?

1700BC:
Unrest, tension and anxiety mark all these years, probably because of some sort of engagement with the Hyksos who ruled Egypt at this time but were expelled from there in the mid-16th century.

Around 1500 BC Thutmose III claimed Cyprus and imposed a tax on the island.

Literacy was introduced to Cyprus with the Cypro-Minoan syllabary, a derivation from Cretan Linear A. It was first used in early phases of the late Bronze Age (LCIB, 14th century BC) and continued in use for c. 400 years into the LC IIIB, maybe up to the second half of the 11th century BC. It likely evolved into the Cypriot syllabary.

Cyprus was a part of the Hittite empire but was a client state and as such was not invaded but rather merely part of the empire by association and governed by the ruling kings of Ugarit.
The Late Cypriot (LC) IIC (1300–1200 BC) was a time of local prosperity. 

during the reign of Tudhaliya IV the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites for either reasons of securing the copper resource or as a way of preventing piracy. Shortly afterwards the island was reconquered by his son Suppiluliuma II around 1200 BCE. Some towns (Enkomi, Kition, Palaeokastro and Sinda) show traces of destruction at the end of LC IIC. 

Mycenaean 'invasion' and subsequent peaceful settlement:
No distinct break in most areas of material culture
In the later phase of the late Bronze Age (LCIIIA, 1200–1100 BC) great amounts of "Mycenaean" IIIC:1b pottery were produced locally.  New architectural features include Cyclopean walls, found on the Greek mainland.
new type of graves (long dromoi) and Mycenean influences in pottery decoration.

Most authors claim that the Cypriot CITY KINGDOMS, first described in written sources in the 8th century BC were already founded in the 11th century BC.

Foundations myths documented by classical authors connect the foundation of numerous Cypriot towns with immigrant Greek heroes in the wake of the Trojan war. For example, Teucer, the brother of Aias was supposed to have founded Salamis, and the Arcadian Agapenor of Tegea to have replaced the native ruler Kinyras and to have founded Paphos. Some scholars see this a memory of a Greek colonisation already in the 11th century. 

In the 8th century (geometric period) the number of settlements increases sharply and monumental tombs, like the 'Royal' tombs of Salamis appear for the first time. This could be a better indication for the appearance of the Cypriot kingdoms. This period shows the appearance large urban centers.

In the 8th century, numerous Phoenician colonies were founded, like Kart-Hadasht ('New Town'), present day Larnaca and Salamis. The oldest cemetery of Salamis has indeed produced children's burials in Canaanite jars, clear indication of Phoenician presence already in the LCIIIB (11th century). 

Iron Age
    Geometric 1050–700 BC
    Archaic 700–525 BC


The late 8th century is the time of the spreading of the Homeric poems, the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey". Funerary customs at Salamis and elsewhere were greatly influenced by these Homeric poems!!!

The deceased were given skewers and firelogs in order to roast their meat, a practice found in contemporary Argos and Crete, recalling the similar gear of Achilles when he entertained other Greek heroes in his tent. Honey and oil, described by Homer as offerings to the dead are also found at Salamis, and the flames of fire that consumed the deceased were quenched with wine as it happened to Patroclus' body after it was given to the flames. The hero's ashes were gathered carefully wrapped into a linen cloth and put into a golden urn.

Appian of Alexandria later wrote ‘some people think that the Iberians of Asia were the ancestors of the Iberians of Europe; others think that the former emigrated from the latter’ (Historia Romana, bk. XII, ch. XV, 101). However, he continued ‘still others think that they merely have the same name, as their customs and languages are not similar’. The Georgian language was also known, confusingly, as Iberian. 





Speaking of Scythia - somewhat bizarrely Scottish legends claim that the Scots were originally from there!

"They journeyed from Greater Scythia by way of the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Pillars of Hercules, and dwelt for a long course of time in Spain among the most savage tribes, but nowhere could they be subdued by any race, however barbarous. Thence they came, twelve hundred years after the people of Israel crossed the Red Sea, to their home in the west where they still live today."

Declaration of Arbroath, 1320.

 the biggest Celtic megalith structures are in northern France.

Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain makes similar claims for Scythian ancestry, and that the Scythians were in turn refugees from Troy.

He also claimed that ancient Britons laid seige to Rome.

Pretty funny how his bullshit survived and was repeated through the centuries.
"And on the way from Scythia the Scots somehow also apparently also picked up the stone that Jacob rested his head on at Bethel which became, via a detour to Dunadd and Scone, the Stone of Destiny!"


It's not an unreasonable legend. Conventional wisdom is that all Indo-Europeans sprang from the steppes of Central Asia. Having it mentioned in a 14th century declaration is pretty fascinating!



Miletus (/maɪˈliːtəs/; Ancient Greek: Μί̄λητος Mīlētos; Hittite transcription Millawanda or Milawata (exonyms); Latin: Miletus; Turkish: Milet) was an ancient Greek city on the western coast of Anatolia, near the mouth of the Maeander River in ancient Caria / Balat! + island of Samos 
Before the Persian invasion in the middle of the 6th century BC, Miletus was considered the greatest and wealthiest of Greek cities.

Beginning at about 1900 BC artifacts of the Minoan civilization acquired by trade arrived at Miletus.[9] For some centuries the location received a strong impulse from that civilization, an archaeological fact that tends to support but not necessarily confirm the founding legend—that is, a population influx, from Crete. 

The Leleges (/ˈlɛlᵻdʒiːz/ LEL-i-jeez; Greek: Λέλεγες) were one of the aboriginal peoples of the Aegean littoral, distinct from the Pelasgians, the Bronze Age Greeks, the Cretan Minoans, the Cycladic Telkhines, and the Tyrrhenians. The classical Hellenes emerged as an amalgam of these six peoples. The distinction between the Leleges and the Carians (a nation living in south west Anatolia) is unclear. According to Homer, the Leleges were a distinct Anatolian tribe;[1] However, Herodotus states that Leleges had been an early name for the Carians.[2] The fourth-century BCE historian Philippus of Theangela, suggested that the Leleges maintained connections to Messenia, Laconia, Locris and other regions in mainland Greece, after they were overcome by the Carians in Asia Minor.[3]
 during the Bronze Age the term lulahi was in use in the Luwian language of the Hittite Empire in Anatolia: in a Hittite cuneiform inscription priests and temple servants are directed to avoid conversing with lulahi and foreign merchants.

  eponymous king Lelex; a comparable etymology, memorializing a legendary founder, is provided by Greek mythographers for virtually every tribe of Hellenes: "Lelex and the Leleges, whatever their historical significance, have acted as a blank sheet on which to draw Lakonia and all it means,"

  Laconia (Greek: Λακωνία), also known as Lacedaemonia, is a region in the southeastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. Its administrative capital is Sparta. The word laconic is derived from the name of the region by analogy—to speak in a concise way, as the Spartans were reputed by the Athenians to do.

  laconic ~ spartanic

  In Homer's Iliad, the Leleges are allies of the Trojans (10.429), though they do not appear in the formal catalogue of allies in Book II of the Iliad, and their homeland is not specified. They are distinguished from the Carians, with whom some later writers confused them; they have a king, Altes, and a city Pedasus which was sacked by Achilles.

  Pylos (Greek: Πύλος), historically also known under its Italian name Navarino, is a town and a former municipality in Messenia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Pylos-Nestoras, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.[2] It was the capital of the former Pylia Province. 
  It was a significant kingdom in Mycenaean Greece, with remains of the so-called "Palace of Nestor" excavated nearby, named after Nestor, the king of Pylos in Homer's Iliad.

"Reconciliation of all these different theories seems out of the question ... the current state of our knowledge of the Greek dialects can accommodate Indo-Europeans entering Greece at any time between 2200 and 1600 BC to emerge later as Greek speakers."

 correlated with other changes in material culture, such as the introduction of iron weapons and alterations in burial practices from Mycenaean GROUP BURIALS in tholos tombs to INDIVIDUAL BURIALS and cremation. These can certainly be associated with the historical Dorian settlers, such as those of Sparta in the 10th century BC.



The scholars were now faced with the conundrum of an invasion at 1200 but a resettlement at 950. One explanation is that the destruction of 1200 was not caused by them, and that the quasi-mythical return of the Heracleidae is to be associated with settlement at Sparta c. 950. It is possible that the destruction of the Mycenaean centres was caused by the wandering of northern people (Illyrian migration).ƒƒƒ

The Vedic period estates were four, Brahmin priests and warrior nobility stood on top, free peasants and traders were the third, and slaves, labourers and artisans, many belonging to the indigenous people, were the fourth.[48][49] This was a period where agriculture, metal and commodity production as well trade greatly expanded,[50] and the Vedic era texts including the early Upanishads and many Sutras important to later Hindu culture were completed.

 Jebel Aqra, properly Jebel al-ʾAqraʿ (Arabic: جبل الأقرع‎‎, [ˈd͡ʒæbæl al ˈʔaqraʕ]; Turkish: Cebel-i Akra), is a limestone mountain located on the Syrian–Turkish border near the mouth of the Orontes River

 The Hurrians called it Mount Hazzi and considered it the home of their storm god Teshub.[1] The Hittites continued his worship, celebrating Teshub's victory over the sea in the Song of Kumarbi found in their capital Hattusa.[5] They also celebrated the mountain in its own right, naming it as a divine guarantor on their treaties and observing rites in its honor.[6] Ζεύς Κάσιος) bis ins 4.

Sapan Zaphon
Im ugaritischen Mythos war der Berg Ṣapanu der Wohnsitz des Wettergottes Baʾalu, Als Baʾalu im Kampf gegen den Totengott Motu umkam, wurde er von seiner Schwester ʾAnatu auf dem Ṣapanu bestattet, bevor sie ihn durch Bezwingung Motus wieder zum Leben erweckte. 
Das hebräische Wort ṣāpôn „Norden“ ist vom Bergnamen abgeleitet
Im Psalm 48,2f wird er mit dem Berg Zion verglichen.

 The ancient port of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra) lies 30 kilometers (19 mi) to its south. Texts discovered there in the 1920s, including the Baal Cycle, showed its residents considered the peak of Mount Sapan (Akkadian, Ugaritic, & Phoenician: Ṣapānu) to house the lapis and silver palace of their storm god Baʿal (lit. "The Lord") and his sister ʿAnat.

Nach einer Version der Typhonsage bekämpfte Zeus den Typhon auf dem Kasion. Es wird sogar vermutet, dass der Name Typhon von dem Namen Ṣāpôn stammt.

 Baʿal is now often identified with Hadad and his variations understood as local cults.

In the winter of 114/15 CE Trajan was spared in a major earthquake that struck Antioch; commemorative coins were struck featuring the shrine of Zeus Kasios, with its pointed roof on pillars, and a representation of its rounded sacred stone, or betyl.[18]

 In spring 363 the last pagan emperor, Julian, scaled the mountain, where he had an epiphanic vision of Zeus Kasios

 Greek theophoric names Kassiodora and Kassiodorus,[19] equally a "gift of Kasios", recall a vow of one or both parents made to ensure fertile conception.

 Ugarit:  UrQuros?  𐎜𐎂𐎗𐎚, ʼUgart; U.G.R.T  
 <> Joghurt?   Ottoman Turkish یوغورت

Neolithic Ugarit was important enough to be fortified with a wall early on, perhaps by 6000 BC

Die ältesten Siedlungsspuren datieren ins 7. Jahrtausend v. Chr. und stammen aus dem frühen Neolithikum (Jungsteinzeit). Im Laufe des 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr. wuchs die Siedlung stark und gewann an Bedeutung. Es gab früh Handel, unter anderem mit Kreta und mit Ägypten, in dessen Schriftquellen die Stadt häufig erwähnt wird.

Evidence of the earliest Ugaritic contact with Egypt (and the first exact dating of Ugaritic civilization) comes from a carnelian bead identified with the Middle Kingdom pharaoh Senusret I, 1971–1926 BC. A stela and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been found.  ONLY:(

Trotz seines Reichtums war Ugarit militärisch schwach und musste sich deshalb mit den Großmächten jener Zeit – den Ägyptern und den Hethitern – arrangieren. So heiratete König Niqmaddu II. eine ägyptische Prinzessin, um die Beziehung zu den ägyptischen Pharaonen zu festigen. Diese hatten allerdings mit der Zeit immer weniger Macht und Einfluss in der syrischen Welt.

Zwischen 1194 und 1186 v. Chr. erfolgten die Angriffe der Seevölker auf Ugarit und die Zerstörung der Stadt.
Ein Hilfegesuch an den hethitischen Vizekönig in Karkemisch wurde abgeschlagen. 
Ugarit wurde von den Angreifern buchstäblich dem Erdboden gleichgemacht. Erst im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. kam es wieder zu einer spärlichen Dorfbesiedlung

Der KönigsPalast (dessen 4m hohen Untergeschoss Mauern noch stehen) wurde schon im Altertum bewundert und Rib-Addi, König von Byblos, rühmt ihn in einem seiner Briefe an den ägyptischen Pharao Echnaton.

In the second millennium BC, Ugarit's population was Amorite, and the Ugaritic language probably has a direct Amoritic origin.

Ab dem 14. Jahrhundert v. Chr. wurde neben der babylonischen Keilschrift für Texte in ugaritischer Sprache auch eine alphabetische Keilschrift verwendet. Das ist der bisher älteste Nachweis dieses Alphabets.
A debate exists as to whether the Phoenician or Ugaritic "alphabet" was first. While the letters show little or no formal similarity, the standard letter order (preserved in the Latin alphabet as A, B, C, D, etc.) shows strong similarities between the two, suggesting that the Phoenician and Ugaritic systems were not wholly independent inventions.

Rb (rabbi/Rapi) bezeichnete den Vorsteher einer Gruppe königlicher Bediensteter. So gab es einen rb mkrm, Vorsteher der Kaufleute(merchants), rab šangū, Vorsteher der Priester(Sanktu), und die Vorsteher verschiedener Dörfer sowie den Vorsteher von Ugarit (rb qrt – wohl eine Art Bürgermeister rabbi Quartier). Verschiedene militärische Grade wurden durch rb ʿlf (Vorsteher der Tausend) bis Vorsteher der Zehn bezeichnet.

The last Bronze Age king of Ugarit, Ammurapi (circa 1215 to 1180 BC 'Amorite Rabbi'), was a contemporary of the Hittite king Suppiluliuma II. 

My father, behold, the enemy's ships came (here); my cities(?) were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots(?) are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the Land of Lukka? ... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.[5]

Since an Egyptian sword bearing the name of pharaoh Merneptah was found in the destruction levels, 1190 BC was taken as the date for the beginning of the LH IIIC. A cuneiform tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed after the death of Merneptah (1203 BC). It is generally agreed that Ugarit had already been destroyed by the 8th year of Ramesses III (1178 BC). Recent radiocarbon work indicates a destruction date between 1192 and 1190 BC.

Minoan peak sanctuaries are widespread throughout the island of Crete (Greece). Most scholars agree that peak sanctuaries were used for religious rites. In all peak sanctuaries, human and animal clay figurines have been found. Clay body parts, also called votive body parts, are also found in most peak sanctuaries. These open-air sanctuaries are found high in the mountains of Crete.

Bethel
Baetylus (also Bethel, or Betyl, from Semitic bet el "house of god") is a word denoting sacred stones that were supposedly endowed with life. According to ancient sources, these objects of worship were meteorites,
A baetyl is also mentioned in the Bible at Bethel in the Book of Genesis in the story of Jacob's Ladder.

Sanchuniathon (Greek: Σαγχουνιάθων; gen.: Σαγχουνιάθωνος) is the purported Phoenician author of three lost works originally in the Phoenician language, surviving only in partial paraphrase and summary of a Greek translation by Philo of Byblos, according to the Christian bishop Eusebius of Caesarea. These few fragments comprise the most extended literary source concerning Phoenician religion in either Greek or Latin: Phoenician sources, along with all of Phoenician literature, were lost with the parchment on which they were habitually written. He is also known as Sancuniates.

Orkhon inscriptions : Göktürks
The earliest known Old Turkic inscriptions are the three monumental Orkhon inscriptions found in modern Mongolia. Erected in honour of the prince Kul Tigin and his brother Emperor Bilge Khagan, these date back to the second Turk Kaghanate.
February 717 – 25 November 734
both Chinese and Old Turkic, relate the legendary origins of the Turks, the golden age of their history, their subjugation by the Chinese, and their liberation by Bilge Khagan.
The scripts follow an alphabetical form, but also appear to have strong influences of rune carvings. The inscriptions are a great example of early signs of nomadic society's transitions from use of runes to a uniform alphabet, and influenced that of the Uighur script and Sogdian(ᠰᠤᠬᠳᠢᠠᠤ) language (PIE! @ Tajikistan (capital: Samarkand).
Sogdian is one of the most important Middle Iranian languages, along with Bactrian, Khotanese Saka, Middle Persian, and Parthian. It possesses a large literary corpus.
During Tang China (ca. 7th century CE), the Silk Road's lingua franca in Central Asia was Sogdian.

 RITUAL (rite-to-all?) CULT OF UNAS (Jonas)
Unas' most immediate legacy is his funerary cult, which continued at least until the end of the Old Kingdom. This cult is attested by the tombs at Saqqara of seven priests responsible for the religious duties to be performed in the funerary complex. 
The funerary cult of Unas established at his death continued until the end of the Old Kingdom and may have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period. The cult was still in existence or revived during the later Middle Kingdom (c. 2050–c. 1650 BC). This did not prevent Amenemhat I and Senusret I (c. 1990–c. 1930 BC) from partially dismantling the mortuary complex of Unas for its materials. In parallel to the official cult, Unas may have received popular veneration as a local god of the Saqqara necropolis until as late as the Late Period (664–332 BC), nearly 2000 years after his death.

In total 283 magical spells, also known as utterances, were carved and the signs painted BLUE.

Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex.[32] Malek doubts the existence of a popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. [even better]

 The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2000 years as shown by the NUMEROUS SCARABS BEARING UNAS' NAME found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550–c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664–332 BC).[116][125][126][127] The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.[128] This activity could explain why the pyramid complex of Unas was the object of restoration works under the impulse of Prince Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC).

Bedawi Beja Beduin
Beja  (also called Bedawi, Bedauye, To Bedawie, Ta Bedawie, Hadareb, or by dialect names; Beja: Bidhaawyeet, Tu-Bdhaawi) is an Afroasiatic language spoken in the western coast of the Red Sea by the Beja people. 


“Some native Egyptian writers were familiar with Coptic, Greek and Arabic (Atiya 1986: 92). This process was undoubtedly helped by the fact that the ancient Egyptian and Arabic languages have so many roots and features in common that it has even been suggested that ancient Egyptian was the basis of Arabic (Kamal, 1917: 331). That ancient Egyptian and Arabic are related (cf. Youssef 2000) should not be more surprising than that Egyptian and Hittites are related. As John Ray has suggested "It is becoming more and more likely that the Semitic, Hamitic and Indo-European languages were originally one"


Critics argue that were one to collect all the words from the various known Indo-European languages and dialects which have at least one of any 4 meanings, one could easily form a list that would cover any conceivable combination of two consonants and a vowel (of which there are only about 20×20×5=2000)

 the Admonitions is not a reliable account of early Egyptian history, because of the long time interval between its original composition and the writing of the Leiden Papyrus.
 It is likely that the poem concluded with a reply of the Lord of All, or prophesying the coming of a powerful king who would restore order

 Ipuwer and the Book of Exodus

The archeological evidence does not support the story of the Exodus, and most histories of ancient Israel no longer consider it relevant.[10][11] Nevertheless, Ipuwer has often put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that "the river is blood" and its frequent references to servants running away. An extension of the same reading is the idea that both Ipuwer and the Book of Exodus are records of a volcanic eruption on the Aegean island of Thera. These arguments ignore the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as the fact that its Asiatics are arriving in Egypt rather than leaving, and the likelihood that the "river is blood" phrase may refer to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or may simply be a poetic image of turmoil.[12]

Amenhotep II = AmenOphis Amenophis ~ office !?  (Manetho’s 18th Dynasty list)


The Egyptians calculate a total of [g200] 24,900 lunar years--2,206 solar years--to the [rule of the] gods, demi-gods, and spirits.
Because it was after the flood that Noah's son Ham became the father of Aegyptus, or Mizraim; and at the time of the dispersal of the peoples, he went to Egypt, as its first inhabitant. According to the Hebrews 2,242 years elapsed from Adam to the flood.

Manetho equated King Memnon with Amenophis (Pharaohs of the 18th dynasty Amenhotep I-IV)
In Greek mythology, Memnon[pronunciation?] (Greek: Mέμνων) was an Ethiopian king and son of Tithonus and Eos. As a warrior he was considered to be almost Achilles' equal in skill. During the Trojan War, he brought an army to Troy's defense
Armesis with Danaos <> Armenian?
Danaus had fifty daughters, the Danaides,  his twin brother, Aegyptus, had fifty sons. 

In Greek mythology Danaus (/ˈdæn.eɪ.əs/; Ancient Greek: Δαναός Danaos), was the twin brother of Aegyptus, a mythical king of Egypt. The myth of Danaus is a foundation legend (or re-foundation legend) of Argos, one of the foremost Mycenaean cities of the Peloponnesus. In Homer's Iliad, "Danaans" ("tribe of Danaus") and "Argives" commonly designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans.

>>IA<< Io (/ˈaɪ.oʊ/; Ancient Greek: Ἰώ [iːɔ̌ː]) was, in Greek mythology, one of the mortal lovers of Zeus. She was an ancestor of many kings and heroes such as: Perseus, Cadmus, Heracles, Minos, Lynceus, Cepheus, and Danaus. 

Noting the rulers’ names and regnal years in the comparative tables, only two entries are the same. The first is Ahmose otherwise Tethmosis/Amosis in Manetho’s rendering, who is given 25 years and 4 months by Josephus and Theophilus, rounded up or down in the other versions, and agreeing with the 25-plus years from the Egyptian inscriptions.
The second is Ramesses [II], otherwise Harmesses Miamun as he is named by Josephus and Theophilus, who is given 66 years and 2 months by them in accord with contemporary Egyptian records for Ramesses II.
Manetho’s Versions in General Agreement with Each Other
All the other names and regnal years allocated in Manetho’s table are different from the previous list of kings, but the Manetho rounded versions show that they come from the same original record. This is further demonstrated by their general adherence to the numbers given by Josephus and Theophilus. Although the numbers in the Book of Sothis have obviously suffered in transmission more than in the other versions, even they can be seen to have once had a common source. Apart from a few apparent errors, Manetho’s versions still give an astonishing amount of concordance considering that numerous copies would have been made over centuries of transmission.
Apart from the two kings mentioned above, the other names and regnal years show no similarity to the names that scholars recognize from the monuments as comprising the kings of the 18th Dynasty based at Thebes. !!

Python, an enemy of Apollo, was always represented in vase-paintings and by sculptors as a serpent. Apollo slew Python and made her former home, Delphi, his own oracle. The Pythia took her title from the name Python.[17]

Asclepius, the son of Apollo and Koronis, learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another (which Asclepius himself had fatally wounded) healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius's care, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning. <> San Taurini

𓏠!!Mehen!! 'coiled' snake-god / board game   Shaman<>Gamen!!! Schmarrn+++ <> zuSammen?
Mehen also appears to have been played outside of Egypt. It appears alongside other boards displaying the game of senet at Bab 'edu Dhra[2] and in Cyprus.[3] In Cyprus, it sometimes appears on the opposite side of the same stone as senet, and those from Sotira Kaminoudhia, dating to approximately 2250 BCE, are the oldest surviving double-sided boards known.[4] Mehen survived in Cyprus longer than in Egypt, showing that the game was indigenized upon its adoption into the island's culture. Also in Levant.
The variability suggests that the number of segments was of little importance to the game. From archaeological evidence, the game seemed to have been played with lion- or lioness-shaped pieces, in sets of three or as many as six, and a few small spheres (marbles or balls).

The rules and gameplay of Mehen are entirely unknown.



Ouroboros (Self eating snake) symbol in Gnosticism and Hermeticism + alchemy. <!!

The first known appearance of the ouroboros motif is in the Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld, an ancient Egyptian funerary text in KV62, the tomb of Tutankhamun, in the 14th century BC. The text concerns the actions of the god Ra and his union with Osiris in the underworld. In an illustration from this text, two serpents, holding their tails in their mouths, coil around the head, neck, and feet of an enormous god, who may represent the unified Ra-Osiris. Both serpents are manifestations of the deity Mehen, who in other funerary texts protects Ra in his underworld journey. The whole divine figure represents the beginning and the end of time.

The symbol persisted in Egypt into Roman times, when it frequently appeared on magical talismans, sometimes in combination with other magical emblems.

The 4th-century AD Latin commentator Servius was aware of the Egyptian use of the symbol, noting that the image of a snake biting its tail represents the cyclical nature of the year.[9]

The famous ouroboros drawing from the early alchemical text The Chrysopoeia of Cleopatra (Greek: Η χρυσοποιία της Κλεοπάτρας) dating to 2nd century Alexandria encloses the words hen to pan (Greek: εν το παν), "one is the all". Western equivalent of the Taoist Yin-Yang symbol.

Homer used the ethnonyms Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers.
isolated reference to a-ka-wi-ja-de in the Linear B records in Knossos, Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.

Egyptian records mention a T(D)-n-j or Danaya (Tanaju) land for the first time in circa 1437 BC, during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmoses III (r. 1479–1425 BC). This land is geographically defined in an inscription from the reign of Amenhotep III (r. circa 1391/1388–1353/1351 BC), where a number of Danaya cities are mentioned, which cover the largest part of southern mainland Greece.[16] Among them, cities such as Mycenae, Nauplion and Thebes, have been identified with certainty. Danaya has been equated with the ethnonym Danaoi (Greek: Δαναοί), the name of the mythical dynasty that ruled in the region of Argos, also used as an ethnonym for the Greek people by Homer.[16][17]

There was a lack of direct contact between Hitto-Luwians and Minoan Crete; the latter was never mentioned in Hitto-Luwian inscriptions. 
Phoenician[edit]
In 2001, the journal Ugarit-Forschungen published the article "The First Inscription in Punic — Vowel Differences in Linear A and B" by Jan Best, claiming to demonstrate how and why Linear A notates an archaic form of Phoenician.[22] This was a continuation of attempts by Cyrus Gordon in finding connections between Minoan and West Semitic languages.

Tyrrhenian +++ !!
Italian scholar Giulio M. Facchetti attempted to link Linear A to the Tyrrhenian language family comprising Etruscan, Rhaetic, and Lemnian. This family is reasoned to be a pre-Indo-European Mediterranean substratum of the 2nd millennium BCE, sometimes referred to as Pre-Greek. Facchetti proposed some possible similarities between the Etruscan language and ancient Lemnian, and other Aegean languages like Minoan.[26] Michael Ventris who successfully deciphered Linear B, also believed in a link between Minoan and Etruscan.[27] The same perspective is supported by S.Y. in Russia.

As Hummel would carry water through the streets, the children would run behind him shouting "Hummel, Hummel!" in order to annoy him. Hummel would shout back "Mors, Mors!", an abbreviation of either "klei di an'n mors!" (go scratch your a**e! or "Klei mi an'n Mors" (Kiss my a**e! ) (there appears to be some dispute over the exact phrase).

Samsun (then known as Amisos, alternative spelling Amisus) was settled between the years of 760–750 BC by people from Miletus --


Around the time Amisus was settled by the Milesians in the 6th century BCE,[6] it is believed that there was significant Greek activity along the coast of the Black Sea, although the archaeological evidence for this is very fragmentary.[7] The only archaeological evidence we have as early as the 6th century is a fragment of wild goat style Greek pottery, in the Louvre !!!

Elamite IMPORTANT till 5th BC!
The most famous Elamite cuneiform inscription comes from the rock inscriptions at Behistun, carved by the order of the Persian king Darius I of the Achaemenid dynasty, around the 5th century BCE.

A basic requirement for deciphering a writing system is a large corpus of texts, but only few examples of Linear Elamite texts have been found so far!! --- wait :::
The complete corpus of Elamite CUNEIFORM consists of c. 20,000 tablets and fragments.

The native Elamite writing system would not endure, as no other examples of Linear Elamite date past the 22th century BCE. And due to the tremendous prestige of Mesopotamian languages and scripts, almost all texts from Elam for the next thousand years were either Sumerian or Babylonian. For 900 years, the Elamite literary tradition remained silent. ---

 Only starting from the 13th century BCE onward did the Elamite language reappear in the archaeological record, but at this point in time the Elamite had borrowed and adapted the cuneiform script to write their language. Unlike their Mesopotamian neighbors which had more than 700 signs, the Elamite cuneiform only contained 145 signs, where 113 were syllabograms, twenty five were logograms, and seven were determinatives. +++

The most famous Elamite cuneiform inscription comes from the rock inscriptions at Behistun, carved by the order of the Persian king Darius I of the Achaemenid dynasty, around the 5th century BCE. At this time, Elamite, Old Persian, and Aramaic, were the "official" languages used in the Persian court and bureaucracy, while older Mesopotamian languages such as Babylonian and Sumerian continued to be used in literary, religious, and scientific circles. As such, Elamite appeared along side with Babylonian and Old Persian on the Behistun inscriptions. The following is an excerpt of the Elamite text.

While IMPORTANT during the early history of the Persian empire(!!), Elamite gradually faded from history after the 5th century BCE as Aramaic became increasingly important as the "international" language of the Persian empire. As such, Elamite has remained an enigma even today.

Scholars fiercely argue over several hypotheses about its origin, but have no definite theory. ;)

Elamite cuneiform comes in two variants, the first, derived from Akkadian, was used during the 3rd to 2nd millennia BCE, and a simplified form used during the 1st millennium BCE.[1] The main difference between the two variants is the reduction of glyphs used in the simplified version.[3] At any one time, there would only be around 130 cuneiform signs in use. Throughout the script’s history, only 206 different signs were used in total ++

The most famous and the ones that ultimately lead to its decipherment are the Elamite scriptures found in the trilingual inscriptions of monuments commissioned by the Achaemenid Persian kings.[4] The inscriptions, similar to that of the Rosetta Stone's, were written in three different writing systems. The first was Old Persian, which was deciphered in 1802 by Georg Friedrich Grotefend. The second, Babylonian cuneiform, was deciphered shortly after the Old Persian text. Because Elamite is unlike its neighboring Semitic languages, the script's decipherment was delayed until the 1840s. Even today, lack of sources and comparative materials hinder further research of Elamite.

Cerberus and Hades/Serapis. <<<
Serapis (Σέραπις, Attic/Ionian Greek) or Sarapis (Σάραπις, Doric Greek) is a Graeco-Egyptian god.
The cult of Serapis was introduced during the 3rd century BC on the orders of Ptolemy I of Egypt[1] as a means to unify the Greeks and Egyptians in his realm. 
evidence which implies that cult of Serapis existed before the Ptolemies came to power in Alexandria – a temple of Sarapis (or Roman Serapis) in Egypt is mentioned in 323 BC by both Plutarch (Life of Alexander, 76) and Arrian (Anabasis, VII, 26, 2). 
 Sarapis was a syncretistic deity derived from the worship of the Egyptian Osiris and Apis (Osiris + Apis = Oserapis/Sarapis)[3] and also gained attributes from other deities, such as chthonic powers linked to the Greek Hades and Demeter, and benevolence linked to Dionysus.

Serapis continued to increase in popularity during the Roman period, often replacing Osiris as the consort of Isis in temples outside Egypt. In 389, a Christian mob led by the Patriarch Theophilus of Alexandria destroyed the Alexandrian serapeum

Evidence of a 'Hattic' civilization is provided by the remnants of one of the non-Indo-European languages found in the later Hittite archives.The language is identified in several of the texts in which it appears by the term hattili- '(written) in the language of Hatti.' The few texts that survive are predominantly religious or cultic in character. They provide us with the names of a number of Hattic deities, as well as Hattic personal and place-names.

Hattian religion traces back to the Stone Age. It involved worship of the earth, which is personified as a mother goddess; the Hattians honored the mother goddess to ensure their crops and their own well-being.[9] The Hattian pantheon of gods included the storm-god TARU!!!! (represented by a bull!!), the SUN-goddess Furu'ŠEMU  (Frau Sonne? represented by a leopard or Wurunšemu ), and a number of other elemental gods. Reliefs in Çatal Hüyük show a female figure giving birth to a bull, i.e.

there's a 9,500-year-old grave in Cyprus with a cat buried alongside its human, and ancient Egyptian art has a popular motif showing house cats eating fish under chairs.
Then the researchers started to see weird data points, like an Egyptian cat at a Viking sea port during the Middle Ages, and Asian cats at a Roman Red Sea port during the height of the Roman Empire.
They realized that many of these cats were spreading along shipping routes. During classical antiquity, ships' captains always kept a cat aboard to remove vermin. By the medieval period, it was unlawful in some places to sail without a ship's cat.
a "local ban on cat trading [was] imposed in Egypt as early as 1700 BCE." 
Though these cats traveled the world with humans, they were never properly domesticated. More specifically, humans did not control their breeding.

The XINGLONGWA culture (興隆洼文化) (6200-5400 BC) was a Neolithic culture in northeastern China, found mainly around the Inner Mongolia-Liaoning border.  pottery was primarily cylindrical, and baked at low temperatures.
The Xinglongwa culture showed several signs of communal planning. At three Xinglongwa sites, houses were built in rows. Several Xinglongwa sites also featured a large central building, Several sites were surrounded by ditches (earliest in CN).
120 pit-houses were discovered at Xinglongwa. Each home had a hearth at its center. 
In the most LAVISH GRAVE, a man was buried with a PAIR OF PIGS, as well as JADE(!) objects.

The LONGSHAN (or Lung-shan 龙山文化) culture, also sometimes referred to as the 'egg-shell' Black Pottery Culture, was a late Neolithic culture in the middle and lower Yellow River valley areas of northern China from about 3000 to 1900 BC.
It decreased in most areas around 2000 BC until the central area evolved into the Bronze Age Erlitou culture.
The most important crop was millet, but rice and wheat have also been found. 
Specialized tools for digging, harvesting and grinding grain have been recovered.[13][14]
The most common source of meat was the PIG.[15] Sheep and goats were apparently domesticated in the Loess Plateau area in the 4th millennium BC(ƒ!!!), found in western Henan by 2800 BC, and then spread across the middle and lower Yellow River area.[16] Dogs were also eaten, particularly in Shandong, though cattle were less important.[15][16]
Small-scale production of silk by raising and domesticating the silkworm in early sericulture was also known.
Ritual
Remains have been found in Shaanxi and southern Henan of scapulae of cattle, pigs, sheep and deer that were heated as a form of divination.[18][19] Evidence of human sacrifice becomes more common in Shaanxi and the Central Plain in the late Longshan period.[18][20]

The MAJIAYAO 马家窑 文化 upper Yellow River Gansu, Qinghai Sichuan. (窑yáo=Ofen)
First time that the Upper Yellow River region was widely occupied by agricultural communities. Famous for its painted pottery, which is regarded as a peak of pottery manufacturing at that time. The oldest bronze object found in China was a knife found at a Majiayao site in Dongxiang, Gansu, and dated to 2900–2740 BC.
Further copper and bronze objects have been found at Machang-period sites in Gansu.[7] Metallurgy spread to the middle and lower Yellow River region in the late 3rd millennium BC.
The manufacture of large amounts of painted pottery means there were professional craftsmen to produce it, which indicates the appearance of social DIVISION OF LABOR.

2200 BC – 1600 BC
The QIJIA 齐家 文化culture (2200 BC – 1600 BC) was an early Bronze Age culture @ upper Yellow River region of Gansu, Lanzhou, Qinghai, China. It is regarded as one of the earliest bronze cultures. 
breeding pigs, which were also used in sacrifices.

Qijia culture is distinguished by a presence of numerous domesticated HORSES, and practice of oracle divination, the metal knives and axes recovered apparently point to some interactions with Siberian and Central Asian cultures, in particular with the >>Seima-Turbino<< complex. 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!! Seima-TURBINO !! 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

FROM FINLAND AND DANUBE TO THAILAND AND MANDSHURIA!!!

Seima-TURBINO phenomenon refers to a pattern of burial sites dating around 1500 BC found across northern Eurasia, 
FROM FINLAND TO THAILAND!!! which has suggested a common point of cultural origin, advanced metal working technology, and unexplained RAPID MIGRATION. The buried were nomadic warriors and metal-workers, travelling on horseback or two-wheeled chariots. The name derives from the Seima (Sejma) cemetery at the confluence of the Oka River and Volga River, first excavated around 1914, and the Turbino cemetery in Perm, first excavated in 1924.[1]

The Altai Mountains in what is now southern Russia and central Mongolia have been identified as the point of origin of the cultural enigma
Artefact types such as spearheads with hooks, single-bladed knives and socketed axes with geometric designs traveled west.

It is conjectured that changes in climate in this region around 2000 BC and the ensuing ecological, economic and political changes triggered a rapid and massive migration westward into northeast Europe, eastward into China and southward into VIETNAM and THAILAND across a frontier of some 4,000 miles.[4] This migration took place in just five to six generations and led to peoples from FINLAND in the west to THAILAND in the east employing the SAME METAL WORKING TECHNOLOGY and, in some areas, horse breeding and riding.
"hotly debated theory among archaeologists." ;)

Recent genetic testings of sites in south Siberia and Kazakhstan (ANDRONOVO horizon) would rather support a spreading of the bronze technology via Indo-European migrations eastwards, as this technology was well known for quite a while in western regions.

Archeologically, Mycenaean chariots, spearheads, daggers and other bronze objects show striking similarities with the Seima-Turbino culture (c. 1900-1600 BCE) of the northern Russian forest-steppes, known for the great mobility of its nomadic warriors (Seima-Turbino sites were found as far away as Mongolia). It is therefore likely that the Mycenaean descended from Russia to Greece between 1900 and 1650 BCE, where they intermingled with the locals to create a new unique Greek culture.

Compare Mycenaean armor with East Siberian Asiatic Koryak Armor!


Since they were not strong enough to settle the steppes(they migrated around the steppes), this means when they reached Europe, they settled in the area where the proto-Slavs appear 1,800-2,000 years later. However they clearly instigated a minor migration from the steppes that brought Mycenaeans to Greece. This forest steppe people also used sledding, for migrating and mobility in war.

today`s Greek population are 30% arvanites -or orthodox albanians, aprox-20& slavs, and 20% vlahs, other part of population are from egyptus and Anatolia. So Haplogroups are close to these ethnys.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were a group of mythological rulers or deities in ancient northern China who in later history have been assigned dates in a period from circa 2852 BC to 2070 BC. Today they are considered culture heroes.[1]
3 Stars (Sun, Moon, Earth)
5 Planets
三皇五帝
These demi-god-kings are said to have helped introduce the use of fire, taught people how to build houses and invented farming. The Yellow Emperor's wife is credited with the invention of silk culture. The discovery of medicine!, the invention of the calendar and Chinese script are also credited to the kings. After their era, Yu the Great founded the Xia Dynasty.

A related concept appears in the legend of the Four shi (四氏) who took part in creating the world. The four members are Youchao-shi (有巢氏), Suiren-shi (燧人氏), Fuxi-shi (伏羲氏), and Shennong-shi (神農氏). The list sometimes extends to one more member being Nüwa-shi (女媧氏), making Five shi (五氏).[5] Four of these five names appear in different lists of the Three Sovereigns.

The following appear in different groupings of the Three Sovereigns: Fuxi (伏羲), Nüwa (女媧), Shennong (神農), Suiren (燧人), Zhurong (祝融), Gong Gong (共工), Heavenly Sovereign (天皇), Earthly Sovereign (地皇), Tai Sovereign (泰皇), Human Sovereign (人皇), and even the Yellow Emperor (黄帝).

The following appear in different groupings of the Five Emperors: Yellow Emperor (黃帝), Zhuanxu (顓頊), Emperor Ku (嚳), Emperor Yao (堯), Emperor Shun (舜), Shaohao (少昊), Taihao (太昊), and Yan Emperor (炎帝).

Chinese archaeologists generally identify the Erlitou culture as the site of the Xia dynasty, but there is no firm evidence, such as writing, to substantiate such a linkage.[3]

Bronze jue (wine vessel)


The discovery of writing in the form of oracle bones at Yinxu in Anyang definitively established the site as the last capital of the Shang, but such evidence is unavailable for earlier sites.(??)

The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project identified all four phases of Erlitou as Xia, and the construction of the Yanshi walled city as the founding of the Shang.[16] Other scholars, particularly outside China, point to the lack of any firm evidence for such an identification

Later:
The earliest CAST-IRON (Gusseisen) artifacts date to the 5th century BC, and were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern Luhe County, Jiangsu in China.
In the west, where it did not become available until the 15th century, its earliest uses included cannon and shot.
Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable.







Pre-imperial Mali

Rock art in the Sahara suggests that northern Mali has been inhabited since 10,000 BC, when the Sahara was fertile and rich in wildlife. By 300 BC, large organised settlements had developed, most notable near Djenné, one of West Africa's oldest cities. By the 6th century AD, the lucrative trans-Saharan trade in gold, salt and slaves had begun, facilitating the rise of West Africa's great empires.

Chad :
Lake Chad is a historically large, shallow, endorheic lake in Africa, which has varied in size over the centuries. According to the Global Resource Information Database of the United Nations Environment Programme, it shrank by as much as 95% from about 1963 to 1998, but "the 2007 (satellite) image shows some improvement.

 At its largest, sometime before 5000 BC, Lake Mega-Chad was the largest of four Saharan paleolakes, and is estimated to have covered an area of 1,000,000 km2 (390,000 sq mi), larger than the Caspian Sea.

The Yuezhi or Rouzhi (Chinese: 月氏; pinyin: Yuèzhī; Wade–Giles: Yüeh4-chih1) were an ancient people first reported in Chinese histories as nomadic pastoralists living in an arid grassland area in the western part of the modern Chinese province of Gansu, during the 1st Millenium BC. After a major defeat by the Xiongnu, during the 2nd century BC, the Yuezhi split into two groups: the Greater Yuezhi (Dà Yuèzhī 大月氏) and Lesser Yuezhi (Xiǎo Yuèzhī 小月氏).



Stonehenge and these wooden circles were thought to have been put up around 2,500 BC.
Apparently not, say the latest tests carried out by a team from the Historic England organisation – the original dating was done from a piece of pottery found in one of the post holes, but this time the researchers looked at the charred remains of the posts themselves.
Based on those remains, collected in the 1980s, it now looks like the timber palisades were thumped into the ground somewhere around 3,300 BC, making this an "unprecedented" find for British archaeologists.

COPPERS IN HARAPPA INDUS VALLEY!
The oldest known example of the lost-wax technique comes from a 6,000-year-old copper, wheel-shaped amulet found at Mehrgarh, Pakistan.[11]

Metalcasting by the Indus Valley Civilization began around 3500 BC in the Mohenjodaro area,[12] which produced one of the earliest known examples of lost-wax casting, an Indian bronze figurine named the “dancing girl” that dates back nearly 5,000 years to the Harappan period (c. 3300–1300 BC).[12][13] Other examples include the buffalo, bull and dog found at Mohenjodaro and Harappa,[3][13][14] two copper figures found at the Harappan site Lothal in the district of Ahmedabad of Gujarat,[12] and likely a covered cart with wheels missing and a complete cart with a driver found at Chanhudaro.[3][14]

During the post-Harappan period, hoards of copper and bronze implements made by the lost-wax process are known from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.[12] Gold and copper ornaments, apparently Hellenistic in style, made by cire perdue were found at the ruins at Sirkap.


LACTOSE TOLERANCE
Gallego Romero et al. (2011) state that their research on lactose tolerance in India suggests that "the west Eurasian genetic contribution identified by Reich et al. (2009) principally reflects gene flow from Iran and the Middle East."[25]
Gallego Romero notes that Indians who are lactose-tolerant show a genetic pattern regarding this tolerance which is "characteristic of the common European mutation."[26] According to Romero, this suggests that "the most common lactose tolerance mutation made a two-way migration out of the Middle East less than 10,000 years ago. While the mutation spread across Europe, another explorer must have brought the mutation eastward to India – likely traveling along the coast of the Persian Gulf where other pockets of the same mutation have been found."[26]

Itjtawy /ɪʃˈtaʊwi/[citation needed] (full Egyptian name Amenemhat-itj-tawy — "Amenemhat, Seizer of the Two Lands"), is the as-yet unidentified location of the royal city founded by Twelfth Dynasty Egyptian King Amenemhat I, who ruled from about 1991 BC to 1962 BC, during year 20 of his reign.[1] It is located in the Faiyum region, and its cemeteries were located at Lisht, el-Lahun and Dahshur. The site of Itjtawy may have been chosen due to its proximity to the source of Asiatic incursions into Egypt to help prevent further attacks.[2]

He outraged the queen and proceeded to make free with the concubines ; then, following the advice of hia friends, he began to wear a diadem and rose in levolt against his brother. <> Odysseus !!

[Josephus is citing the records of neighbouring nations in proof of the antiquity of the Jews.]
 I will begin with Egyptian documents. These I caniiot indeed set before you in their ancient form ; 
 but in Manetho we have a native Egyptian who was manifestly imbued with Greek culture. He wrote in Greek the history of his nation, translated, as he himself tells us, from sacred tablets ; 
 and on many points of Egyptian history he convicts Herodotus of having erred through ignorance.
Manetho:
" Tutimaeus. In his reign, for what cause I know not, a blast of God smote us ; and un- expectedly, from the regions of the East, invaders of obscure race marched in confidence of victory against our land. By main force they easily seized itwithoutstrikingablow; * andhavingoverpowered the rulers of the land, they then burned our cities ruthlessly, razed to the ground the temples of the gods, and treated all the natives with a cruel hostility, massacring some and leading into slavery the wives and children of others. 
Finally, they appointed as king one of their number whose name was Salitis<<. He had his seat at Memphis, levying tribute from Upper and Lower Egypt, and always leaving garrisons behind in the most advantageous positions(!). Above all, he fortified the district to the east, foreseeing that the Assyrians, as they grew stronger, would one day covet and attack his kingdom.
" In the Salte [Sethrolte] nome ^ he found a city very favourably situated on the east of the Bubastite branch * of the Nile, and called Auaris<< after an ancient religious tradition.^ This place he rebuilt and fortified with massive walls, planting there a garrison of as many as 240,000 heavy-armed men to guard his frontier. Here he would come in summer- time, partly to serve out rations and pay his troops, partly to train them carefully in maneuvres(!) and so strike terror into foreign tribes. After reigning for 19 years, Salitis died ; and a second king, named Bnon,^ succeeded and reigned for 44 years. Next to him came Apachnan, who ruled for 36 years and 7 months ; ^ then Apophis for 61, and lannas for 50 years and 1 month ; then finally Assis for 49 years and 2 months. These six kings, their first rulers, were ever more and more eager to extirpate the Egyptian stock. Their race as a whole was called Hyksos,^ that is ' king-shepherds 'sacred language means ' king,' and sbs in common speech is ' shepherd ' or ' shepherds 'compound word ' Hyksos '. Some say that they were Arabs." ^ In another copy * the expression hyk, it is said, does not mean " kings " : on the contrary, the compound refers to " captive- shepherds ".^ In Egyptian hyk, in fact, and hak when aspirated expressly denote " captives ".* This explanation seems to me the more convincing and more in keeping with ancient history.

During the 14th and 13th centuries B.C.E., many of the royal scribes in the Canaanite coastal city of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra in Syria) were trained in a unique form of the wedge-shaped cuneiform script. Unlike the normal cuneiform script, which includes hundreds of signs, the new Ugaritic script is made up of only a couple dozen.

The proof that we are not dealing with an independent alphabetic invention is twofold. First, the order of the cuneiform alphabetic signs is essentially the same as the order of the iconic Proto-Canaanite alphabetic signs. Second, the names of the alphabetic cuneiform signs go back to the iconic meanings of the signs of the Proto-Canaanite script, although the Ugaritic cuneiform is not pictorial at all. All this is evidenced in abecedaries like one found in Ugarit.

During the ninth century B.C.E., the alphabet became the official script of the entire Near East.
The alphabet was invented only once. All alphabetic scripts derive from this original one, which we may call the Serabit alphabetic script.
